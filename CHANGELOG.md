# Changelog

All notable changes to Hivelore are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) loosely and the
project follows semantic versioning once it ships its first stable release.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.64.0] — Quiet integration, session continuity and measurable outcomes

- Keep briefing and feedback read-only for shared memories; remove corpus writes from merge hooks and health CI. Newly generated bridges use stable navigation without rotating breadcrumbs.
- Exercise actual MCP briefing and provide `agent check --exercise`: isolated context injection, validated GREEN/RED sensor checks and measured no-op hook latency. Make project Claude configuration portable and fix nested-package root discovery.
- Deliver small, complete file-specific instructions with source/evidence; avoid read-only shell context injection and load the full CLI only when a hook needs it.
- Preserve task baselines through compaction, isolate context receipts by session, and restore task checkpoints. Add MCP `session_id`/`context_reset` support.
- Default new repositories to local completion and draft capture. Add one-line memory save, quieter verification and structural qualified Java anchors. Preserve existing repository completion policies.
- Add explicit local outcome accounting and a balanced three-arm benchmark preparation protocol. Distinguish observed delivery, reported utility and sensor catches; no inferred time savings or unperformed benchmark claims.
- Document migrations, reproducible proof, regression coverage and the remaining independent field-validation work in `docs/product-excellence-0.64.md`.

## [0.63.1] — Repair MCP access across AI clients

- Repair Codex registration through its native CLI: replace dead `haive` commands, retain other servers and explicit disabling, and stop pinning global MCP to one project.
- Preserve JSONC comments and client settings during migration; refuse malformed files instead of silently replacing them. Cover VS Code user configurations and detected Gemini CLI/Roo Code projects as well as Claude Code, Cursor and Windsurf.
- Honor the MCP project-root environment variables, with explicit CLI arguments taking precedence. Project configurations also pass an explicit root.
- Add `hivelore agent check` for bounded MCP initialization/tool discovery. Status and doctor inspect Hivelore entries, report Codex problems, and distinguish configuration from active-session access.


## [0.63.0] — Useful context, evidence and task-aware completion

- Briefings prioritize actionable memories over project overviews and recaps. Long bodies share the budget; quick CLI output omits redundant navigation. Only delivered memories count as consulted.
- Confidence no longer rises with retrieval count. Promotion requires confirmed applications; human-reviewed, tested evidence is required for the authoritative tier. Freshness follows verification rather than reads.
- Add optional `evidence`, `checks` (literal assertions against current files) and `supersedes` metadata to memory save/update. Contradicted claims are excluded from automatic context; explicit reads explain the failed check. Supersession cycles remain visible.
- Add task completion contracts (`read`, `local`, `commit`, `release`) and local task baselines. Unchanged pre-existing edits no longer block a task. Existing repositories retain the release default.
- File hooks emit only new applicable context, isolate consultation markers by session and detect the actual file effects of shell scripts through Git snapshots.
- Local policy checks include new untracked files. Presence sensors examine the correct worktree/index content and catch deletion of required content.
- `sync` repairs exact Git rename anchors conservatively; ambiguous renames and memories with pending edits remain untouched.
- Enforcement no longer rewrites/stages corpus content or builds a semantic index during a check. Consultation coverage uses the same retirement and exclusion rules as briefing.
- Bootstrap/distillation reminders move to advisory `maintenance_notices`; explicit human approval stays in `action_required`.
- MCP tool usage is recorded centrally, including `mem_get` reads. CLI briefing calls establish session accounting boundaries.
- PR comments deduplicate memories across files, default to five unique memories and cap total output. Missing context is no longer described as evidence of team understanding.
- CI integration failures are described without assuming a transient cause. `enforcement.requiredCiWorkflows` keeps named integration workflows mandatory.

See [feedback implementation notes](docs/feedback-2026-09-18-implementation.md) for contracts, limitations and regression coverage.


## [0.62.0] — Everything the two 2026-09-05 field reports asked for

Two agents wrote independent reports the same day, from opposite seats — one reviewing and writing
the task sheets, one executing them — and agreed on more than they disagreed. This release works
through their combined list. Nothing here removes a capability; every item removes noise, time, or a
false assurance.

### `enforce check` no longer reports a green it never evaluated

`--stage local` — the stage the generated `CLAUDE.md` tells every agent to run before its final
response — skipped the anti-pattern + sensor diff scan and still printed `✓ gate passed`. It was
visible only in `--json`, as an `info` among six green lines. Twelve PR descriptions in one report
and eight in the other carried "hivelore enforce check: 0 issues" as a guarantee covering the one
check that differentiates the product, which that stage had never run.

`local` now scans the worktree diff (`git diff HEAD` — staged AND unstaged, because an agent asks
before it stages) with the same rules the commit hook uses, so what the agent is told matches what
will happen at commit. Evaluations from a preview are logged to the sensor ledger as `manual`, never
as `pre-commit`, so prevention statistics stay honest. Where a scan genuinely is deferred — pre-push,
whose commits were each scanned as they were made — the pass line now says
`… 0 issue(s), 1 deferred (antipattern-gate)` instead of a bare "passed".

### `briefing-loaded` says whose briefing it found

The strict `requireBriefingFirst` check asked "does any marker in the directory fall inside the 12 h
TTL". An agent that never called `get_briefing` once across eight PRs passed it eight times, on a
marker another session had left at 23:58 the night before. The finding now names the marker's
provenance and age — `briefing-loaded` for this session, `briefing-marker-present` (with "this check
confirms a marker, not that the current agent read anything") for someone else's — and
`requireBriefingFirst: "session"` makes the strict reading actually strict. `enforce check --session`
plus `$HIVELORE_SESSION_ID` / `$HAIVE_SESSION_ID` / `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` give the CLI a session to
scope to.

### `hivelore sensors coverage` — where a rule can be broken with the gate silent

A "no hardcoded credentials, even in tests" sensor was scoped to `frontend/src, backend/src/test/java`
while the secret went into `docker-compose.yml`. GitGuardian caught what the corpus had described
nine days earlier: the right rule, the right file and the right moment all existed, and the scope
kept them apart. A sensor scope should follow the INTENT of the rule, not the directory where the
mistake was first seen — a scope that is too narrow is worse than no sensor, because it reads as
coverage.

The new command runs every regex sensor's own pattern against the whole tracked tree and lists the
matches its scope excludes, widest hole and block sensors first. Documentation is skipped (a content
sensor can never fire on a doc reached through a scope, so it is never a real hole).

### The session recap is dated, and expires

`## Last session` was printed undated at the top of every session. In one repo it was eight days and
thirty PRs old, described a product name that had since been decided and a payment integration that
had since shipped. The briefing now carries `as_of`, `age_days`, `commits_since` and `stale`, the
header reads `## Last session — 2026-08-27, 8d ago, 30 commit(s) since`, and past 7 days or 25
commits the stale claim is replaced by the last five commit subjects — always true, free, and enough
as a safety net. Better nothing than a confident wrong answer.

### `pr-memory-check`: no more comment about the roadmap

- **High-churn files are excluded from matching.** Four of eight PRs matched `docs/roadmap.md` and
  nothing else — four identical comments, enough for a reviewer to stop reading the block. Files
  touched by ≥40% of the last 60 commits carry no information in a diff; they are now measured from
  the repo's own history (never a guessed filename list) and dropped. With too little history to
  measure, nothing is excluded. When only such files matched, no comment is posted at all.
- **Matching is on path segments, not string suffixes.** `changeNorm.endsWith(anchorNorm)` matched
  any two paths sharing a tail, which is how a twenty-line `frontend/public/images/README.md` drew a
  comment about monorepo version tagging.
- **Sensors armed on the changed files are listed first** — the memories that can actually refuse the
  change, which is what would have informed the two PRs the old comment got wrong.

### `finish` stops waiting on things that cannot refuse the change

Six times in one week `finish` blocked on `github-actions-pending` because a SonarQube workflow — not
a required check — was still running: 5 to 12 minutes each, on pushes whose build, tests and gate had
all passed. Advisory workflows are now advisory whether they failed or have not finished. And a job
the runner never started (an exhausted Actions minutes budget stops every job in an account) is
classified as infrastructure rather than a verdict on the code: reported, never blocking. A run that
failed with steps that ran and did not fail stays blocking — the ambiguous case fails closed.

### `code-map.json` leaves the git tree

It accounted for 40 of one repo's 88 commits, forced eight `git stash`es in a single day to allow a
branch switch, and rode into three unrelated feature PRs as a 105/75/25-line diff — a machine-written
file in a repo whose own convention says "never commit a generated artifact". It now lives in
`.ai/.cache/code-map.json`. An existing tracked copy is still read, and is deleted on the next write,
so the migration is one deletion in one commit instead of a file that keeps coming back. `hivelore
init` adds it to `.gitignore`.

### `pr-eval-gate` stays out of the way until it can fail

Twenty runs, twenty times "score 100/100 · no baseline · regression gate skipped", each paying a cold
`npm install -g` of the CLI out of the account's Actions minutes. The generated job now checks for
`.ai/eval/baseline.json` BEFORE installing anything, and says once, as a notice, how to enable it.

### Uncaptured failures are surfaced where the agent can still act

The counter existed and was right — seven hard failures never written down in a session that shipped
eight PRs — but it only appeared at `finish`, when the agent has stopped working. It now runs at
pre-push too, and instead of "call `mem_tried`" it hands over a `hivelore memory tried` command
already filled in with the failure the harness observed.

## [0.61.1] — The per-tool-call hooks cost 2 s each for nothing

Two independent field reports on 2026-09-05 (§3 and §7) measured the same thing from two different
seats: `hivelore enforce pre-tool-use` and `hivelore observe` each took ~2.3 s per invocation, on a
trivial payload, with `user` time of 0.29 s. Both hooks run on **every** `Edit`, `Write` and `Bash`,
so an ordinary session of 200-300 tool calls paid **15 to 20 minutes of pure waiting**, in two-second
slices nobody notices one at a time.

It was not Node startup and not corpus loading. `readStdin` armed a 2 s hard cap
(`setTimeout(finish, 2000)`) so a stuck hook could never block Claude — but never cleared it. The
payload was read in milliseconds; the timer then held the event loop open for the remaining ~2 s
before the process could exit. The hard cap is still there, now cleared on finish and `unref`'d, so
it protects against a stuck stdin without charging every healthy call for it.

Measured on the same machine as the reports, same command, same payload:

| Hook | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| `hivelore enforce pre-tool-use` | 2.39 s | **0.27 s** |
| `hivelore observe` | 2.38 s | **0.26 s** |

≈ 4.7 s per tool call becomes ≈ 0.53 s — a 9× cut, and the 15-20 minutes per session goes away
without removing a hook, narrowing a matcher, or changing what either hook does. `test/hook-latency.test.ts`
spawns both hooks and fails if either takes more than 1.5 s to exit, so the leak cannot come back
unseen.

## [0.61.0] — Remove the knowledge-layer health score

Asked for by three consecutive field reports (2026-09-01, 09-02 §3.5, 09-04 §6), each saying the same
three things: it moved without a visible cause, nobody knew how to raise it, and it never blocked.

Reading what it computed explains all three. It was `100 − Σ penalties of the findings this
invocation produced`, with content catches excluded — so:

- an empty repo with no corpus at all scored **100%**, the maximum;
- a repo with 44 memories and 16 sensors scored **0%** as soon as one `error` finding with impact 100
  fired — an uncommitted file, a red CI. That is the reported "0% with a full corpus": not a bug, the
  formula;
- the observed "95% then 87%, unchanged corpus" was exactly `100 − 8 (briefing-missing) − 5
  (bootstrap-incomplete)`, the first appearing and disappearing with the freshness of a local marker;
- a block sensor catching a real mistake — the knowledge layer doing its job — moved it by zero
  points, being classified as a content catch.

It measured how many complaints an invocation produced, and called that the health of the knowledge
layer. A number whose name designates something other than what it measures cannot be acted on.

### Removed

- The `knowledge-layer health: N% (target M%)` line from every `enforce` stage.
- The `enforcement-score-below-threshold` finding (already hidden from the interactive gate in
  0.58.0 — which was the admission that it was not useful).
- `enforcement.scoreThreshold` from the config schema and both posture defaults.
- `score` from the `enforce --json` report, and `baseline_health` from the core gate verdict.
- `computeBaselineHealth`, `buildBaselineHealthFinding` and the `BaselineHealth` type from
  `@hivelore/core`.

Nothing else changes: what refused a change, and why, is reported exactly as before.

## [0.60.1] — `finish` checks the whole lockstep set, not one package

- **`enforce finish` now verifies every publishable package against the registry.** It asked about
  one representative package, which assumes publication is atomic. It is not: `publish:all` runs one
  `pnpm publish` per package, so any of them can fail alone (expired OTP, 403) while the others land.
  That produces a PARTIAL publish — a registry set that cannot install itself — and nothing watched
  for it. On 0.60.0, core/cli/embeddings shipped and `@hivelore/mcp` did not; since cli pins its
  siblings exactly, every `npm i -g @hivelore/cli` failed with
  `ETARGET  No matching version found for @hivelore/mcp@0.60.0`, while `finish` reported a bland
  "publish is the next step" about core and said nothing about the break.
- **New `npm-publication-incoherent` verdict (warn).** The severity split is preserved: nothing
  published yet stays informational (the normal state at `finish` time, before publishing), a tagged
  version the registry skipped stays a warning, and a partially-published set is now a warning too —
  because dependents are broken at that moment. A package the registry could not be reached for is
  never counted as behind.

## [0.60.0] — Scope, exceptions, and a gate you can actually pass

Continues the 2026-09-02 and 2026-09-04 field reports where 0.59.0 stopped. That release fixed what
the breadcrumb *contained*; this one fixes what the gate *does* — the two reports agree that the
damage is no longer missing features but rules that fire where they shouldn't and gates that cannot
be passed, both of which teach agents to ignore enforcement wholesale.

### Sensors get a scope (09-02 §3.2, 09-04 §3.1)

- **`sensor.exclude`** — a per-sensor negation list `paths` could not express. A production-only
  lesson (`no any`) keeps `paths: ['**']` and adds `exclude: ['**/*.test.*', '**/__tests__/**', …]`
  instead of being narrowed file by file. A lesson that IS about tests leaves it empty and still
  fires there. `propose_sensor` takes it and documents when to set it.
- **Documentation files are out of scope for content sensors.** A `.md`/`.rst`/`.adoc` reached
  through a wildcard or prefix scope is never matched — example code in prose does not ship. A
  sensor that names the doc file exactly still fires on it, so an intentional doc rule works.

### Sensors get an exception mechanism (09-04 §3.1)

- **`// hivelore:allow <memory-id> — <reason>`** waives one line for one sensor. Before this, a false
  positive had exactly two outlets: rewrite correct code, or delete the rule — and "a linter with no
  exception mechanism ends up disabled" costs the whole rule rather than the one line. The waiver is
  end-of-line only (a waiver on the preceding line silently covers the next one, which is how a
  one-off becomes a blanket suppression), requires a reason, and must name the rule it excuses.
  Every use is reported as a `sensor-waived` finding, so the exception stays auditable — and the
  block message and the `CLAUDE.md` hard-rules block both tell agents it exists.
- **`propose_sensor` now says when a pattern matches its own memory's prose** — the 09-04 false
  positive was detectable three days before it fired. It is a caveat, not a rejection: documenting a
  rule normally means quoting what it forbids.

### `enforce finish` stops blocking on what it does not own (09-02 §3.3, 09-04 §5)

The exit gate mixed three natures of check and blocked on all of them. Only knowledge blocks now:

- **`bootstrap-incomplete` no longer blocks `finish`** (warns instead). Bootstrapping a repo is a
  project, not a precondition for finishing one bugfix — and its prescribed fix is an MCP prompt,
  unreachable in exactly the sessions where the MCP layer is down. It made the gate unpassable for
  entire sessions, which also discredited `github-actions-pass`, the one check catching a real agent
  defect.
- **A CI run that failed only on infrastructure steps** (artifact upload over the account's storage
  quota, cache, toolchain setup) is a warning, not a blocker. The build and the tests ran and passed;
  a knowledge tool has no business gating on someone's billing state. Classified from which STEPS
  failed — no log download — and any doubt keeps the gate blocking.
- **Untracked-only worktrees warn instead of blocking.** Nothing tracked was modified, so no work is
  at risk — and the untracked files were routinely the memories `mem_save` had just written, the tool
  manufacturing its own blocker. Real uncommitted work still blocks.

### Generated workflows reach the branches repos actually use (09-04 §4.3)

- **`hivelore-sync.yml` push triggers are rendered from the repo's own integration branches**
  (`main`/`master`/`develop`, detected at `init`), not hardcoded to `main`/`master`. In a gitflow
  repo the sync job simply never ran: two blocking sensors lived in `.ai/memories/` for six days
  without ever reaching `CLAUDE.md` — rules that failed commits, invisible to every agent expected
  to obey them.
- **The workflow now calls `hivelore bridges sync`.** `sync` only touches `.ai/`; the breadcrumbs
  agents actually read are written by `bridges sync`, which was called nowhere. Both are covered by
  the generated-workflow regression tests.

### The `haive` → `hivelore` rename is finally swept (09-04 §7.5)

Reported three times as a repo bug, because the repo is where everyone looked — `hivelore init` has
always written a correct project `.mcp.json`. The failing entry lives in the USER-scope client config
(`~/.claude.json` and friends), survives reinstalls, and fails with `ENOENT: haive-mcp` at the start
of every session in every project.

- **`hivelore doctor` detects it; `--fix` removes it.** Only entries whose command is the dead binary
  are touched.
- **A stale `haive` key no longer counts as "already configured"** — that check was why setup skipped
  writing the working entry, keeping the broken one alive.

### Quieter gate (09-02 §3.4)

- `briefing-missing` and `bootstrap-incomplete` join the standing-state codes hidden from the
  interactive gate (still in doctor/CI/`--explain`). They never blocked and printed identically on
  all ~20 commits of a session — the mechanism by which a tool's output stops being read.

## [0.59.0] — Rank the breadcrumb, finish the comment fix, stop breaking git

The 09-02 and 09-04 field reports converged: the one artefact that delivers value — the memory block
injected into `CLAUDE.md` — was being filled by `ls | sort | head`, and three shipped defects were
eroding trust around it. This release fixes the highest-yield items from both reports' priority lists.

### The breadcrumb is ranked, not alphabetically sorted (§1, §1.1)

- **The `CLAUDE.md`/AGENTS.md memory list now ranks by value, not filename.** Sorting by id (which is
  date-prefixed) surfaced the 8 OLDEST memories and buried everything written after day one —
  including every `attempt`, whose entire worth is stopping a repeat of a known dead end. The order is
  now: validated first, then `attempt`, then `decision`/`architecture`, then the rest, most-recent
  first within each tier.
- **A block sensor's breadcrumb is now its corrective instruction, not its regex.** The full pattern
  was ~63% of the breadcrumb budget and taught the agent nothing the hook doesn't already enforce.

### Sensors finish learning to read comments (§3.1)

- **Multi-line block comments are now stripped before a regex sensor matches.** The v0.57.7 fix was
  per-line, so a forbidden token on a MIDDLE line of a `/* … */` block (which starts with neither the
  opener nor `*`) still tripped the sensor — exactly the recurring CSS `bg-emerald-600`-in-a-comment
  false positive. Comment state is now tracked across lines. String literals are still kept, so a
  sensor can target a bad literal in a string.

### A tool that runs during `git commit` no longer writes tracked files (§3.1 09-02)

- **`sensor.last_fired` is no longer stamped into the memory `.md`.** Writing a git-tracked file from
  inside the pre-commit/pre-push hook dirtied the tree mid-commit and aborted a `git checkout`,
  stranding the next command on the wrong branch. Prevention proof lives in the gitignored cache
  (`usage.json` + the prevention log), where it belongs.

### Smaller, sharper (§2.1, §4)

- **A blocked gate now names the escape hatch:** "Blocked wrongly? Flag it with `report_friction`."
  Friction was only ever reported into commit messages because the one natural moment — the block —
  never mentioned the tool.
- **The generated `hivelore-sync.yml` is fixed in three places:** PR checks (memory-check, stale-check,
  eval-gate) now run on **every** PR, not only PRs into `main`/`master` (gitflow repos merge into
  `develop`, and two blocking sensors stayed invisible for six days because of this); `pr-stale-check`
  now declares `contents: read` so `actions/checkout` works on private repos; and the stale count is
  read from the real "N stale" figure instead of `grep -c stale`, which counted the "0 stale" summary
  line and posted a false "stale memories detected" alarm on every PR.

## [0.58.1] — Recaps keep their history; sensors nudge toward AST

### The recap stops forgetting the last three sessions (§5.6)

- **A topic-upsert recap now archives the outgoing session into a bounded per-session history** instead
  of overwriting it. The field report could not tell what the previous three sessions did, because
  each `mem_session_end` overwrote the last (`revision_count: 12`, history gone). The newest recap
  still sits at the top — so the briefing head keeps surfacing only the latest goal + next steps
  (v0.58.0) — with each prior session kept as one compact dated entry beneath a `## Session history`
  heading, capped at 6. The full record is one `mem_get <id>` away. Applied to both the MCP and CLI
  session-end writers via the pure `buildRecapWithHistory`.

### `propose_sensor` points at AST for parseable languages (§3.1)

- **The `kind` guidance now recommends `ast` for a parseable language when the engine is available.**
  A structural AST match can never false-positive on a comment or a string; regex (still the default,
  since it needs no extra engine) now strips comments before matching but deliberately keeps string
  literals so it can still target a bad literal. The default is unchanged — flipping it to AST would
  break sensor creation everywhere the optional `@ast-grep/napi` engine is not installed — but the
  nudge is now explicit rather than buried.

## [0.58.0] — Stop the noise: no junk seeds, no zero-count receipts, quieter gate, leaner recap

Acts on the "remove / transform" backlog from the 2026-09-01 field report (§5, §7). The theme is
subtraction: every item here removes output that was noise, keeping the signal that earns trust.

### Sensor seeds: no more prose-mined patterns (§5.1)

- **`mem_save` / `mem_tried` no longer pre-fill a `proposed_sensor_seed`.** The prose miner produced
  unusable patterns 7 times out of 7 in the field, and a visibly wrong first suggestion teaches agents
  to stop reading the sensor loop — the most valuable thing Hivelore does. The tools now report the
  open loop and route to `propose_sensor` (which validates) or to `hivelore sensors propose --from-fix
  <ref>`, which mines the ACTUAL fix diff — the only trustworthy auto-source, and it is kept. The
  gate-miss draft points at the revert diff instead of guessing from the commit subject.

### The prevention receipt stops advertising zero (§5.7)

- **No PR comment when nothing fired and the window is empty.** The pre-commit gate blocks locally, so
  by design almost nothing reaches review — yet the receipt posted "No documented sensor fired · Weekly
  total: 0" on every PR, including docs-only ones. `renderPreventionComment` now returns empty in that
  case and the CI workflow skips the comment. When a sensor actually fires, or the rolling window has
  activity, the receipt posts as before.

### A quieter interactive gate (§5.4)

- **`enforcement-score-below-threshold` and `decision-coverage-missing` no longer print on interactive
  runs.** They describe the repo's standing baseline, not the change being committed, and were the two
  most frequent, least actionable nags. They stay in the report for `doctor`, CI, and `--explain`, and
  they never blocked. The `/100` currency-divisor case below also stops being mislabelled.

### Must-read recaps stop costing 3000 tokens per briefing (§5.6)

- **The briefing head carries only the recap's goal + next steps**, not the whole goal/accomplished/
  discoveries/next-steps wall. A session with five briefings paid five times to re-read a recap the
  agent had just written. The full recap stays in the corpus, reachable with `mem_get <id>`.

### A narrower brittleness heuristic (§5.3)

- **A `/100` divisor is no longer flagged as a hardcoded line number.** The heuristic that keeps
  brittle line-number patterns out of block sensors mistook the decimal base of a minor-currency
  conversion for a line number, forcing the author to widen an exact pattern into an approximate one
  (`1[0-9]{2}`, which also accepts `/137`). A number preceded by a literal `/`, an escaped `\*`/`\/`,
  or a `[/*]` char class is now recognised as arithmetic; a bare quantifier `*` is not.

## [0.57.8] — A gate that names its stage, and a briefing floor that adapts

Two more items from the 2026-09-01 field report: the gate that appeared to print twice (§4.4) and the
semantic ranking that stopped discriminating on a broad corpus (§4.1).

### The pass line names its stage

- **`Hivelore gate passed (pre-commit)` / `(pre-push)`** (field report §4.4). One `git` action fires two
  hooks — pre-commit then pre-push — each with its own check count. Unlabelled, the two lines read as a
  single gate printed twice with mismatched numbers ("7 then 6"), and the report author could not tell
  whether it was two hooks, two passes, or a display bug. The stage is now named, so the two lines are
  self-explaining.

### The briefing floor adapts to the corpus

- **Semantic-only hits are floored at the corpus distribution, not an absolute cutoff** (field report
  §4.1). On ~40 memories cosine scores compress into a narrow band (everything > 0.55), so an absolute
  `min_semantic_score` of 0 sorted nothing and the same three or four unrelated memories surfaced at
  ~0.6 for every task. The default now applies an adaptive floor at `mean + ½σ` of the hit
  distribution: it trims the undifferentiated mass on a compressed distribution, always keeps the top
  hit, never drops below an explicit caller floor, and does nothing below 12 samples so small corpora
  (and the retrieval eval) are untouched. Retrieval recall held at 98% with no new misses.

## [0.57.7] — Stop the sensors punishing the docs that explain them

A fourth field report (nine sessions, 40 memories, 16 sensors) found the sensor layer had crossed from
neutral to net-negative: the only three sensors that ever fired all fired on prose — a CSS comment, a
Javadoc, and a correct test — costing a CI cycle each and training the author to stop naming the rule
next to the code it guards. This release fixes the three highest-yield, deterministic items from that
report (§8).

### Sensors match code, not the comments that document them

- **Regex sensors blank comment spans before matching** (field report §3.1). A CSS block comment naming
  `bg-emerald-600`, a Javadoc line naming `LocalDate.now()`, and a `//` line comment no longer trip the
  sensors that enforce those rules. String literals are left intact on purpose — many sensors
  legitimately target a bad literal inside a string (a hardcoded colour class, URL, or secret), so a
  `className="bg-emerald-600"` still fires. Covers C-family, hash, CSS/SCSS, SQL, and HTML/Markdown
  comment syntaxes (`stripCommentsForScan`), reporting the original line.

### The CI gate says why it refused

- **Enforcement failures now print the findings** to the job log and `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` — code,
  severity, matched line, and fix — instead of a bare `exit 2` no one could read (field report §4.2).
  Applied to this repo's workflow and to the template `hivelore init` writes into every repo.

### Must-read memories arrive with their substance

- **`format: "actions"` no longer truncates a memory to its opening sentence** (field report §5.2). A
  memory that opens with a short delivery accroche ("Lot 8, livré le…") then carries its real content in
  the following prose now returns as many paragraphs as fit the budget, not just the first.

## [0.57.6] — Guard a deletion, and stop the gate rubber-stamping

A third field report — five sessions, 25 memories, 11 sensors — reached a sharp verdict: the anchored
session memory is the product's real value, while the sensor layer over-promises (11 sensors, 1 fire,
none of the five real defects caught). This release acts on the parts of that critique that are
deterministic and testable, and records the rest as a backlog memory so the next agent knows where to
start (`2026-08-29-decision-field-report-backlog-multi-sessions`).

### Guard a deletion, not just an addition

- **Presence sensors (`require_present`).** A regex sensor can now be a REQUIRED-PRESENCE invariant:
  `pattern` names a line that must REMAIN in the anchored file, and the sensor FIRES when a change
  removes it — evaluated on the file's final content, the one class of invariant a diff-of-added-lines
  sensor structurally cannot see (the "don't delete the UTC default" lesson). Propose it with
  `propose_sensor({ require_present: true })`; it is validated by requiring the marker to be present in
  the current code (there must be something to guard). Wired into the commit/CI gate.

### The gate says what it means

- **An inverted sensor is refused at any severity.** A proposal whose pattern fires on the lesson's own
  recommended-correct code was only rejected for `block`; a `warn` in the same state was silently
  accepted and became permanent noise. It is now refused for `warn` too (field report §3.4).
- **A warn sensor that fires on current code no longer reads as a clean pass.** `propose_sensor` returns
  an explicit caveat naming what it fired on, instead of a bland `accepted: true` — so an agent isn't
  nudged to arm a guard that cries on correct code.

### Prevention evidence that survives a clone

- **`sensor.last_fired` is stamped into the memory file** on a real prevention, not only into the
  gitignored usage cache — so a fired guard's proof travels with the repo (field report §4). Rare and
  debounced, so it does not churn like a per-read counter would.
- **No trend verdict on a tiny sample.** The prevention receipt stops printing "recurrences
  rising/declining" when the sample is too small to mean anything (a 0→1 jump is not a trend, §5).

The broader items — read-telemetry visible in the repo, historising the PR receipt, trimming the
prose-extracted sensor seed, memory-summary extraction, bridge-file dedup — are captured in the backlog
memory with their design tradeoffs, not silently dropped.

## [0.57.5] — Guard the write path, not just the sensors

Two independent field sessions on real repositories reached the same conclusion: Hivelore's rigor
stops at the sensors, and the path that *creates* corpus value — writing a memory, arming a guard —
is the least protected. This release closes those loops. Every change is deterministic and covered by
a regression test named for the symptom it prevents.

### No silent corpus loss

- **An unreadable corpus file now fails the gate.** A hand-written memory with an unsupported `type`
  (e.g. `reference`) parsed nowhere, was invisible to every briefing, yet the gate said "passed" over
  it — a lost team lesson nobody learned about unless they happened to run `doctor`. The gate now
  emits a blocking `invalid-memory-files` finding, closing the gap between what `doctor` saw and what
  the gate enforced.
- **Invalid frontmatter says why.** `parseMemory` used to surface a truncated ZodError that reached
  `doctor` as the meaningless `([)`. It now names the field, the offending value, and the allowed set
  (`invalid type: "reference" … expected one of: convention | decision | gotcha | …`).

### A guardrail is never silently replaced

- **A second `propose_sensor` no longer overwrites the first.** Proposing a *different* guardrail onto
  a memory that already carries a hand-authored sensor is refused (`sensor-exists`) unless the caller
  passes `replace: true` / `--replace`. Refining the same sensor (warn→block, tuning `absent`) and
  upgrading an autogen suggestion stay allowed — those are the intended loop. Previously both calls
  answered `accepted: true` and the second silently destroyed the first.

### Decided is not implemented

- **New `lifecycle: applied | planned | abandoned`**, orthogonal to `confidence`/`status`. A `planned`
  decision can be fully trusted *as a decision* while being false *as a description of today's code*.
  Set it via `mem_save` (MCP) or `hivelore memory save --lifecycle`; `planned`/`abandoned` memories are
  surfaced distinctly in the briefing (`[PLANNED — decided, NOT yet implemented]`) so an agent does not
  write code against a route/field/version that was only ever decided.

### Sharper feedback, less noise

- **The brittle-sensor heuristic no longer rejects IP/port literals or regex escapes.** A pattern like
  `https?://127\.0\.0\.1:\d+` was wrongly flagged as a "hardcoded line number"; `\d \w \s` escapes and
  dotted-quad IPs/versions are now exempt, and the message names the offending token.
- **"Invalid anchor" is no longer mislabeled "stale".** When a memory anchors to a file that does not
  exist in this repo, the gate says so, suggests the likely rename, and points at the command that
  actually repairs it (`memory update --paths`) instead of `verify --update`, which only relabels.
- **The false "one-time" semantic-index message is gone** when the embedder cannot load — it was
  printed on every commit because the build never succeeded. The `--embed` failure now always carries a
  non-empty cause instead of an empty `index build failed:`.
- **`enforce finish` no longer blocks on its own regenerated `.ai/code-map.json`** — a deterministic,
  Hivelore-owned artifact is not the agent's uncommitted work.

### MCP config drift after the rename

- **`doctor` detects a dead `.mcp.json`.** The `haive → hivelore` rename left configs pointing at a
  `haive` binary that no longer exists (a field session ran with a silently dead MCP the entire time).
  `doctor` now flags `"command": "haive"` (not only `haive-mcp`), scans a few parent directories (the
  monorepo-root config Claude Code actually loads), and `--fix` migrates it to `hivelore`.

## [0.57.4] — A tag is not a release


`enforce finish` learned to check the npm registry in 0.57.3. It still could not see the other end
of the chain: this repo carried **190 version tags and zero GitHub Releases** for four months, and
the only thing that ever noticed was a third-party listing scoring the project down for it.

They are not the same signal. npm is where the code is *installed from*; a GitHub Release is where a
version is *announced* — changelog, provenance, and the artifact that directories, score checkers
and humans read to decide whether a project ships.

### The pre-adoption rule is the whole design

The naive check — "every tag should have a Release" — would have produced 189 warnings that no
action could ever clear, and a warning you cannot clear is one people learn to scroll past. So only
tags **newer than the oldest existing Release** count as gaps. Adopting the practice at v0.57
retroactively cleans nothing, and is not asked to.

Verified against this repo's real 187 semver tags, in all three states:

```
187 tags, no Release   → ℹ github-releases-absent    (one line, points at the current version)
187 tags, v0.57.3 out  → ✓ github-release-published  (the 186 older tags stay silent)
v0.58.0 tagged, unreleased → ℹ github-release-pending
v0.58.0 + v0.58.1 skipped  → ⚠ github-releases-skipped
```

Severities mirror the npm check exactly and for the same reason: `finish` runs BEFORE the Release is
cut, so "HEAD has no Release yet" can only be info. Never an error — releasing is the human's call.
Drafts do not count as published; a long gap is capped at five listed versions plus a count. Off
with `enforcement.githubReleaseCheck: "off"`.

The verdict logic is pure, in `core/github-release.ts`; `gh release list --json` and `git tag` stay
in the CLI, so all seven cases are unit-tested without a network call.

### Also: one ordering, not three

Three byte-identical copies of the version comparator existed — two in `core`, one in `enforce.ts` —
because each new release check wrote its own instead of looking for one. Extracted to
`core/version-order.ts`. Two gates reading the same tags must not be able to disagree about which
one is newer.


## [0.57.3] — `enforce finish` checks the last link of the release chain

The gate verified commit, version, tag, push and CI — everything except whether the release actually
shipped. Three consecutive versions sat tagged and green while npm stayed several behind, because
the publish workflow **skips rather than fails** when its token is absent. Green CI on an
unpublished release looks exactly like a shipped one, so nothing ever said a word.

`enforce finish` now asks the registry.

**The severity split is the design.** `finish` runs BEFORE you publish, so "HEAD's version is not on
npm yet" is the normal state and is reported as **info** — a gate that cannot pass in the normal flow
is a gate people switch off. A tagged version the registry **skipped** is a **warning**: it was
tagged, so it was meant to ship, and it silently never did. It never blocks; publishing is the
human's call.

```
⚠ npm-releases-skipped: 1 tagged release(s) never reached npm — @hivelore/cli is on 0.57.1: v0.57.2.
  fix: Registry versions are not cumulative, so publishing the newest is enough: …
```

Best-effort throughout: no registry, no network, a private package or none at all are all "cannot
tell", never a failure. The package name is derived from the manifests that already carry the
lockstep version rather than hardcoded, so it works outside this repo, and a single-package repo
resolves to its root `package.json`. Disable with `enforcement.npmPublishCheck: "off"`.

The verdict logic is pure and lives in `core/npm-publication.ts` — the registry lookup and tag
listing stay in the CLI, so the six severity cases are unit-tested without a network call.


## [0.57.2] — Documentation is a deliverable, so it gets checked like one

Both READMEs had drifted six weeks behind the code and described a gate that no longer exists. The
fix is not the edit — it is that nothing was comparing the prose to the source.

### Merged: each claim now lives in exactly one README

The two pages serve different purposes — the root README is the concepts, `packages/cli/README.md`
(the npm landing page) is the exhaustive command manual, 83% of which is the command reference and
its unique value. They overlapped only in their *claims*, which is exactly where they drifted into
saying different, both-wrong things.

The 55 duplicated conceptual lines were removed from the npm page and replaced with a link. They are
not synchronised; they exist once. The npm page keeps absolute asset URLs because relative paths do
not resolve on npmjs.com — the real reason the two files cannot simply be one.

### `hivelore tui` never existed

The npm README documented it with its own section, a screen table and a keybinding table. There is
no `registerTui`; invoking it falls through to the root usage banner. The command is
`hivelore dashboard`, and **the CLI's own help text cited the phantom too** — `dashboard --help`,
`memory digest` output, and a core doc-comment all pointed at it. All corrected.

### New: `packages/cli/test/docs-accuracy.test.ts`

Covers the failure modes that actually occurred, and was verified to fail on each:

- **Phantom commands** — every `hivelore <cmd>` cited is INVOKED, not looked up in `--help`. Hidden
  back-compat aliases (`install-hooks`) are real and absent from help; a command that was never
  registered falls through to the usage banner. Only invocation tells the two apart.
- **Non-existent config keys** — every `enforcement.<key>` must exist in `config.ts`.
- **Pre-rename filenames** — `haive.config.json` and `haive-enforcement.yml` were renamed in v0.51
  and survived in the npm README for six weeks.
- **Undocumented MCP tools** — the default profile's tool list must be fully documented; 4 of 15
  were missing, including `propose_sensor`, cited three times in prose as the differentiator.
- **Re-duplication** — the conceptual sections must not reappear on the npm page.


## [0.57.1] — Churn needs a real sample, or it is not a measurement

`v0.57.0` scored 96 locally and **94 in CI on the same commit**, and the eval gate caught it.

Anchor specificity is IDF over recent commits, and IDF over one document is meaningless.
`actions/checkout` defaults to depth 1, so a shallow clone is the normal state in CI: `git log -200`
returned a single commit, every file it touched scored 100% churn, and **every anchor was classified
weak**. Strictly worse than not measuring at all — and it would have hit any user whose checkout is
shallow, on their machine only.

- `MIN_CHURN_SAMPLE = 20`: below it, churn is reported as unknown, which ranks exactly as before.
- The repo's own `ci` workflow now checks out with `fetch-depth: 0`, so the eval gate keeps
  exercising the ranking it exists to protect rather than silently falling back.


## [0.57.0] — The briefing ranks by how much an anchor actually tells us

A field report scored briefing usefulness **30/100** while `hivelore eval` reported **98% recall**.
Both numbers were correct. This release is what sat between them.

### What the measurement found

Replaying the last 25 real commits through the briefing — ground truth taken from anchors rather
than from a hand-written query — showed the median commit had **34 memories legitimately claiming
`must_read`** for 8 slots. Recall@8 was pinned near its arithmetic ceiling and the slots went to
whichever plausible memory sorted first.

The cause, measured over 149 commits: **`package.json` is touched by 106 of them (71%)**. A lesson
about cross-package dependency ranges therefore declared itself `must_read` on every release commit.
The median memory claims 12 of 60 commits; the p90 claims 36.

An anchor match was treated as the strongest signal available regardless of how much it discriminates.

### The correction

`anchor-specificity.ts` weights a match by how rare the matched path is — plain IDF, applied to
anchors. An anchor touched by more than 35% of recent commits no longer promotes a memory on its
own; it needs a strong semantic hit or a symbol match. Specificity also breaks ties **within** a
tier, so among memories that legitimately matched, the discriminating one comes first.

Corroboration deliberately excludes `exactTaskMatch`: it is a literal AND-match over the whole
memory body, and on a task-shaped corpus it fires on nearly everything — a `chore: bump version`
commit marked every `package.json` lesson `exact` and promoted all of them straight back, silently
defeating the check. Literal body overlap is precisely the "global textual relevance" the report
identified as the ranking's weak point.

| measured on 25 real commits | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| mean specificity of the matched anchor | 0.73 | **0.82** |
| briefing slots spent on a low-information anchor | 17% | **4%** |

Churn is measured with one `git log -200`, cached in gitignored `.ai/.cache/` and invalidated by
HEAD. **Unmeasurable churn scores 1**, so a repo without git history ranks exactly as it did before.

### `hivelore doctor` now names the memories to re-anchor

`memory-broad-anchors` lists the memories anchored only to files most commits touch, with the share
of commits each anchor claims. The fix is always additive — give the lesson the precise path it is
really about — and it turns an invisible ranking problem into a corpus-hygiene task.

### The eval baseline was re-cut, deliberately

`hivelore eval` went **97 → 96** (MRR 0.946 → 0.939). Recall stayed at 98% and no case became a
miss: the drop is a slightly lower rank, never a lost memory.

The eval cannot see the benefit by construction — its cases ask *"given a query written to find
memory X, does X surface?"*, which never puts two anchors in competition. That blind spot is exactly
why it reported 98% while a real session reported 30/100. Do not recover the point by relaxing the
rule; add cases where several memories legitimately match the same files.

### Fixed — the passive-capture detector fired on its own source code

Of 256 real observations captured in this repository, **all three `failure_hint` flags were false
positives**, and the third fired while investigating the second: running
`grep -A22 "function detectFailure" observe.ts` was recorded as a failure because its output *is*
the list of error strings the function matches on. Reading the detector triggered the detector.

A command that exited 0 did not fail, whatever words appear in its output. Text signatures are now
only a fallback for when the harness reports no exit code at all; exit codes stay authoritative and
remain guarded against commands that routinely return non-zero.


## [0.56.0] — Making the existing parts excellent: one decision rule, one posture, one line per refusal

No new capability. Six things Hivelore already did, done properly — each one chosen from friction
observed while working in this repository, not from a wish list.

### The gate has ONE decision rule, and it lives in core

`enforce.ts` held **three separate downgrade passes** over the same process-gate codes, applied one
after another. Each arrived with a different bug fix; none knew about the others. The verdict
therefore depended on their execution order, which was written down nowhere, and adding a fourth was
the obvious way to fix the next report.

There is now one pass, in `packages/core/src/gate-verdict.ts` (`decideVerdict`), pure and free of
filesystem and git. It paid for itself immediately: extracting the rule exposed a regression the
rewrite had introduced — the human carve-out was being applied in CI, where it must never apply,
because CI validates the merged result on everyone's behalf. A unit test caught it before release.

The rule now reads in one breath: **process gates refuse only when the repo asked for it, only at a
sharing point, and only for whoever they are meant to bind.** One clause is not a knob and is not
negotiable: they never refuse a local commit, at any posture.

### One posture instead of two dozen interacting switches

`enforcement` had grown to twenty-four independent knobs whose combined verdict nobody could predict
— including the people who wrote them. New **`enforcement.posture`**: `advisory` (reports, never
refuses), **`balanced`** (default — refuses on deterministic, code-bound findings only), `strict`
(process gates bind at pre-push and CI too). The individual switches still win when set explicitly,
and `hivelore doctor` now always prints the effective posture plus any overrides.

### A refusal is one line about one lesson

The anti-pattern matcher and the sensor runner both legitimately fire on the same memory. Reported
separately, a single bad line produced **four lines of output** — twice in the headline, twice in
the findings list — at exactly the moment attention is most worth spending.

```
- 🛡️  A documented lesson refused this commit:
-     • 2024-02-02-attempt-no-moment  Pre-commit policy matched 1 blocking anti-pattern(s), 0 stale…
-     • 2024-02-02-attempt-no-moment  Block sensor fired — 2024-02-02-attempt-no-moment: Use date-fns…
- ✗ precommit-policy-block: Pre-commit policy matched 1 blocking anti-pattern(s)…
- ✗ sensor-block: Block sensor fired — 2024-02-02-attempt-no-moment: Use date-fns, not moment. (src/d.ts)
+ 🛡️  A documented lesson refused this commit:
+     • 2024-02-02-attempt-no-moment (src/d.ts)  Use date-fns, not moment.
+       import moment from 'moment';
```

### The score measures one thing, and says which

It summed penalties from the repo's cold knowledge layer AND from the diff under review. One number,
two meanings, so no trend in it could be acted on. It is now **knowledge-layer health**: computed
from the repo's standing state only, content catches excluded, and labelled as what it is. It has
not blocked anything since v0.55.0 and it still does not.

### Every generated artifact is validated in its own format

v0.55.0 added YAML parsing for generated workflows after one shipped unparseable. The same gap was
still open for git hooks — **no shell syntax check existed anywhere in the suite** — and a broken
pre-commit hook breaks every commit in every repo that installed it. `sh -n` now runs over every
managed hook, including when appended after a foreign hook such as husky's.

The rule this generalises: what Hivelore *computes* had 892 tests; what Hivelore *delivers* had none.
A generated file is a deliverable. Parse it, or run it.

### The sensor seed generator tests itself against the lesson's own counter-example

It proposed an inverted pattern three times in the field — most recently `uses\s*:\s*["']?Doucs91`,
lifted from the very line showing how to consume the action *correctly*. `propose_sensor` rejects
these, so nothing unsafe could ever be armed, but a visibly absurd first suggestion teaches agents to
stop reading the loop — and the sensor loop is the most valuable thing Hivelore does.

A candidate is now matched against the lesson's own "Instead, use" / "How to apply" sections before
being emitted, and dropped if it fires on them. Discriminating sensors are exempt when their `absent`
companion is present, so "X without Y" lessons still produce seeds. No seed beats an inverted seed.

### Feedback speed

The gate's rule has 18 unit tests that run in **~30 ms**; the equivalent coverage previously required
the 104-second CLI integration suite. Parallelising that suite was tried and reverted: vitest 2.1.9
resolves worker paths through a URL and collects zero tests when the checkout path contains a space
(`.../New idea` → `New%20idea`). Recorded as a lesson with a `block` sensor so nobody re-attempts it.
The durable fix is the one applied here — keep logic that can be decided from inputs alone out of the
integration suite.


## [0.55.0] — Field-report release: the gate refuses on evidence, and what we ship actually runs

A user ran Hivelore end-to-end through a real working session on two production repositories
(Spring Boot 3.4 / React 19) and wrote it up: nine PRs merged, a security fix, two CI pipelines
repaired. They scored it **62/100**. This release is that report, worked through.

Two findings were not opinions — they were things we shipped broken and never tested.

### Fixed — reliability

- **The generated `hivelore-enforcement.yml` was not valid YAML.** The `Upsert prevention receipt`
  step embedded a multi-line `jq -nr` program inside a double-quoted YAML scalar; TypeScript turned
  the `\n` escapes in the template literal into real newlines, which dedented the program to column 1
  and terminated the scalar. GitHub could not parse the file, so it ran **zero jobs** and reported
  only *"This run likely failed because of a workflow file issue"* — a permanent, undiagnosable
  failure on every PR and push, in every repo that had run `hivelore init`. The reporter deleted the
  file from two repositories by hand.
  The receipt body is now rendered by the CLI (`hivelore stats receipt --comment --gate <file>`,
  backed by `renderPreventionComment` in core), so the generated workflow contains a command and
  never a program. `packages/cli/test/generated-workflows.test.ts` parses every workflow `init` and
  `enforce install` emit; it was verified to fail on the pre-fix artifact with the reporter's exact
  error (*line 47, column 1*).

- **The published GitHub Action shipped without its dependencies.** tsup externalises
  `dependencies` by default — correct for the CLI and MCP packages, exactly wrong for a composite
  action that runs a committed `dist/` from a bare checkout with no `npm install`. The 12 KB bundle
  opened with `require("@actions/github")` and died with `Cannot find module '@actions/github'` on
  every pull request in every adopting repo. Now bundled (528 KB, Node built-ins only) via a real
  `tsup.config.ts`; `test/bundle.test.ts` asserts no external require, and CI both verifies the
  committed bundle is in sync and **runs it** in an empty directory — `npm pack` could never have
  caught this.

- **A broken embeddings install took the whole briefing down.** Every call site wrapped only the
  dynamic `import()` in a try/catch and left the `semanticSearch(...)` call outside it. The import is
  cheap; the search is where the transformers runtime and its native dependencies actually load. So
  on a machine where those were broken — the ordinary state after a Node major upgrade
  (`Cannot find module '../build/Release/sharp-*.node'`) — the exception escaped and aborted
  `get_briefing` instead of falling back to lexical ranking. New `runSemantic` helper covers load
  **and** call at every site (briefing, `mem_search`, `code_search`), and the messages now separate
  "not installed" from "installed but its runtime failed to load" — telling someone to install a
  package they already have is what made this so hard to diagnose. This is a large part of why the
  report scored briefing quality 30/100 and saw `--embed` fail with the package present.

- **`.ai/code-map.json` is versionable again.** It serialized an absolute `root` (one developer's
  home directory) and a `generated_at` stamped on every run, so 528 KB of JSON produced a conflicting
  diff on every `sync` for every developer — the file could neither be committed nor ignored, since
  `doctor` asks for it. Both now live outside the payload (`root` and `generated_at` are back-filled
  on load, so every consumer is unchanged), file keys are sorted, and an unchanged scan does not
  rewrite the file at all.

### Changed — the gate refuses on evidence, and only on evidence

The report's central charge: *"what creates value (the sensors) is optional and manual; what creates
friction (the compliance score) is automatic and blocking."* Two pushes were refused, both carrying
tested code with a green SonarQube gate and zero violations, and **not one penalty was about the
code** — `briefing-missing (−35)`, `session-recap-missing (−20)`, `bootstrap-incomplete (−5)`. The
predictable answer to that is `git push --no-verify`, which costs the developer the whole gate,
sensors included. A gate routinely bypassed protects nothing.

- **New `enforcement.processGate`, defaulting to `"warn"`.** Process gates (briefing, session recap,
  decision coverage, bootstrap) now report at every stage and refuse at none. Only deterministic,
  code-bound findings block: block sensors, anti-pattern blocks, stale anchors on touched files,
  artifact hygiene. Set `processGate: "block"` for the previous behaviour.
- **The composite score no longer blocks anything.** "Enforcement score 40% is below required
  threshold 85%" is a measurement, not a verdict, and it moved for reasons unrelated to the change
  under review. It is still computed and still names its top penalties — and it is now suppressed
  entirely when something did refuse, so a real block is never buried under score noise.
- **A refusal names the offending line.** Regex sensor findings carry `file` and `matched_line` (the
  AST branch already did), both in the gate output and in the PR receipt comment.
- **Stale anchors block only on files the change touches.** `stale-important-memories` was computed
  over the entire corpus, so a push was refused for a memory anchored somewhere the author never
  went — punishing whoever passes through rather than whoever introduced it. Stale anchors elsewhere
  are now reported as `stale-memories-elsewhere` (warning, corpus maintenance).

### Changed — ergonomics

- **Stack packs are opt-in.** Seeding them by default filled a new corpus with generic advice nobody
  wrote for the repo; the first briefing of a real session read `thin · must_read=0 useful=0
  background=3`, all three being stack-pack platitudes. An empty corpus is more honest — it says
  plainly that it needs filling. `hivelore init --stack auto` still seeds them.
- **`bridges sync --all` asks first.** It writes 12 files; on a Claude-and-Cursor repo, seven are for
  clients nobody there runs. It now lists them and requires `--yes`. The default target set gained
  machine detection, so it covers the clients actually in use rather than only pre-existing files.
- **A rejected `block` sensor explains the way out.** `fires-on-current` only ever said "add or
  tighten `absent`", which assumes an imprecise pattern. The far more common cause went unnamed: the
  pattern is right and **the faulty code is still there** — the normal state when you document a
  problem before fixing it, which makes arming the sensor impossible exactly when you want to. Both
  causes are now named, and the warn-first path (arm as `warn` → fix → promote to `block`) is spelled
  out with the exact command. Shared by the CLI and MCP via `explainSensorRejection` in core.
- **Repeated advisories stop repeating.** The bootstrap checklist is six lines worth reading once and
  wallpaper on the fiftieth commit. Full text once per 24h, one line otherwise; `--json` and
  `--explain` always carry the complete message.
- **Anchorless memories get suggested anchors.** `memory save` without `--paths` now offers the files
  named in the body that actually exist in the repo, prefilled into the `memory update` command.
- **`init` says the MCP server needs a client restart** — clients read their server list only at
  startup — and names the CLI equivalents that work right now.
- **Discoverability.** Three capabilities the report asked for already existed and could not be
  found: PR review comments → memories (`ingest --from github-pr <n>`), and structural sensors
  (`sensors propose --kind ast|shell|test`, which route Sonar/ESLint/ArchUnit/Semgrep or the team's
  own suite). Both are now surfaced in the help where someone would look. `get_briefing` also says
  when it was called without `files`, since anchor proximity is its strongest ranking signal and the
  caller is the only one who can supply it.


## [0.54.0] — Friction journal — agents report Hivelore's own bugs, humans publish them

Agents hit friction with Hivelore itself and had nowhere to put it, so it evaporated at the end of
every session. The obvious fix — let the agent open a GitHub issue — is the one to avoid: curl
scrapped its bug bounty in January 2026 after unreviewed AI submissions became, in the maintainers'
words, a *"DDoS-like situation"* (~5% genuine). It would also break
`2026-06-02-decision-tools-must-be-environment-independent` (a token in every user's environment) and
hand every agent a write path to a public tracker from inside a customer's repo.

So: **capture at zero friction, publish at high friction.**

- **`report_friction` MCP tool** (in the DEFAULT `enforcement` profile — 14 → 15 tools; an agent only
  reports in the session where it hit the problem and will not switch profiles to do so). Appends to
  a machine-local journal at `.ai/.runtime/friction.jsonl`. **No network, ever.**
- **Evidence bar.** `kind: "bug"` requires a runnable `repro`; without one the report is kept but
  filed as `suggestion`, and the agent is told why. This is the sensor layer's own doctrine — an
  oracle that never went RED cannot claim protection — turned on Hivelore's feedback channel.
- **Deduplication is the prioritisation.** Reports are fingerprinted on kind + surface + a normalised
  summary (case, whitespace, absolute paths and long digit runs collapsed), so a rephrased repeat
  raises the count instead of forking a new entry. The tool returns `already_reported` and the
  occurrence count, which tells the agent to stop and gives the maintainer a free ranking.
- **`hivelore report list | submit | dismiss`** (advanced surface) is the human gate. `submit` prints
  a **preview** and requires `--yes` to create anything, warns against publishing secrets or customer
  code, and falls back to a prefilled URL when `gh` is absent rather than adding a hard dependency.
- **`doctor`** surfaces `friction-unreviewed` (always `info` — feedback about the tooling is never a
  defect in the user's repo), otherwise a write-only journal nobody reads.
- **`report_friction` is deliberately not in `MUTATING_TOOLS`**, i.e. not gated behind "a briefing was
  loaded". The friction being reported may be that the briefing failed; gating the feedback channel
  behind the thing that might be broken would silence exactly the reports worth having.

8 new core tests; verified end-to-end over stdio in a throwaway repo (evidence bar, dedup, list,
preview-only submit, dismiss, doctor surfacing, and absence from `git status`).


## [0.53.5] — Gate reports untracked files honestly

`enforce finish` called every dirty path *"modified but not committed"*, including paths git reports
as **untracked** (`??`). The two are not the same problem and do not have the same fix: a modified
file must be committed, while an untracked one is committed **or** ignored. The wrong noun sent the
developer hunting for a change that did not exist.

- **`getGitSyncStatus` now separates `untrackedFiles` from `dirtyFiles`**, parsing the `??` marker off
  the porcelain status line instead of collapsing every state into one list.
- **The finding says what is actually true**, in three shapes: untracked-only → *"N file(s) are
  untracked — neither committed nor ignored."*; mixed → *"N file(s) are uncommitted (M modified, U
  untracked)."*; modified-only keeps the original wording. The shippable variant now says *"are not
  committed"* rather than *"are modified"*, which was wrong for an untracked shippable file.
- **The fix line offers the second exit** when the dirtiness is untracked-only: *"Commit them — or add
  them to .gitignore if they are meant to stay local. Untracking a file without ignoring it leaves the
  worktree permanently dirty."* That is the actual trap: a file untracked but never ignored blocks
  this gate on **every later task**, and `hivelore init` itself leaves `.mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`
  and `.vscode/` untracked — so a freshly initialised repo walks straight into it.

Also: `docs/launch/` added to this repo's `.gitignore`, completing the intent of dd54870 (untracked as
a local draft, but never ignored — which is what surfaced the misleading message in the first place).

Verified against a throwaway git repo across all four states: shippable, untracked-only, mixed, and
resolved-by-ignoring.


## [0.53.4] — Expose mem_update in the default MCP profile

The default `enforcement` profile was **create-only** for memories: it shipped `mem_save` but no way
to correct what was written. That is a real defect, not a cosmetic one — `mem_save` rejects a
duplicate body with the message *"use `mem_update` to modify"*, so the agent was pointed at a tool it
could not call, and its only escape was to write a near-duplicate memory that pollutes the corpus
everything else ranks over.

- **`mem_update` added to `ENFORCEMENT_PROFILE_TOOLS`** (13 → 14 tools), removed from the maintenance
  list which already spreads enforcement. The memory lifecycle in the default profile is now
  create / read / search / verify / **update**.
- **`mem_delete` deliberately NOT added.** `memDelete` unlinks the file with no confirmation and no
  archive, and deleting a memory that carries a **block sensor** silently removes enforcement —
  the very thing the `sensor-weakened` gate exists to surface. Deletion stays a maintenance-profile,
  human-initiated operation. Rationale recorded in
  `2026-08-17-decision-enforcement-profile-exposes-mem-update-not-mem-delete`.
- **`pre_commit_check` description** now states that the three signals it names
  (`anti_patterns_check`, `mem_for_files`, `mem_verify`) are run *internally by that one call* and are
  not invoked separately — two of the three are not in the default profile, so naming them bare read
  as a pointer to uncallable tools.

Found by auditing every tool name referenced in the exposed descriptions against the profile's actual
surface; `mem_save → mem_update` was the only true dangling reference and is now resolved.


## [0.53.3] — MCP tool-definition polish for the Glama listing

Glama grades a listed server on **Tool Definition Quality (70%) + Server Coherence (30%)**, where the
server-level score is `60% × mean + 40% × minimum` — a single weak tool drags the whole grade down.
An audit of the 13 tools in the default `enforcement` profile found two defects, both fixed here
before cutting the Glama release that freezes those definitions as the graded input:

- **`get_briefing`**: `include_project_context` and `include_module_contexts` were the only two
  parameters in the entire exposed surface shipping without a JSON-Schema `description`, costing on
  the *Parameter Semantics* axis (15% of the per-tool score). Both now document what they include,
  when to turn them off, and how they interact with `dedupe_project_context` / `budget_preset`.
  All 13 tools are now at 100% documented parameters.
- **`pre_commit_check`**: an internal layer-map annotation had leaked into the description as a
  bracketed aside wedged between "Combines three signals:" and the list of those three signals,
  breaking the opening sentence (*Purpose Clarity*, 25%, and *Conciseness & Structure*, 10%). The
  information is kept — it usefully places the tool against `hivelore enforce check` — but moved
  below the list and rewritten as prose.

No behaviour change: descriptions and schema metadata only.


## [0.53.2] — Rename cleanup: kill remaining `haive` leftovers on the user surface

Follow-up to the v0.51.0 rename (`haive` binary removed). A pass over the surfaces a user or an
MCP directory (Glama) actually sees:

- **`hivelore doctor` fix hints** no longer point at the removed `haive` binary — and no longer
  suggest the non-existent `memory auto-promote` command. `pending-review` now suggests
  `hivelore memory approve <id>`; `stale-draft-memories` suggests `hivelore memory delete <id>`.
  `memory pending` prints `hivelore memory approve --all` instead of the dead `auto-promote`.
- **MCP server logs** now use the `[hivelore-mcp]` prefix (startup + fatal) instead of the legacy
  `[haive-mcp]` — visible in any client's MCP log pane and in the Glama introspection log.
- **Corpus/bridges**: the two pinned convention memories and the module contexts were rebranded
  `hAIve`/`@hiveai/*` → `Hivelore`/`@hivelore/*`; all 12 generated bridge files regenerated so the
  team's context no longer shows the old brand. Internal identifiers (`runHaive`, `HAIVE_*`,
  `haive.config.json`, `<!-- haive:… -->` markers, bridge filenames) stay unchanged — backward
  compatible by design (see [0.30.0]).
- **Docker/Glama**: added a repository `Dockerfile` (+ `.dockerignore`) that builds the pnpm
  workspace and runs `hivelore mcp --stdio`, verified to answer the MCP `initialize` + `tools/list`
  introspection the Glama listing check requires.


## [0.53.1] — MCP Registry publishing metadata

- `@hivelore/mcp` now carries `mcpName: "io.github.Doucs91/hivelore"` so the package can be published
  to the official [MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) (the registry validates
  that the npm package's `mcpName` matches the server's registry name).
- Added `server.json` (the registry manifest), `docs/mcp-registry.md`, and
  `scripts/publish-mcp-registry.sh` — everything automatable for registry publishing; the human only
  completes the GitHub device-flow `mcp-publisher login` + `publish`. No runtime change.

## [0.53.0] — Ruthless polish: onboarding, quiet gate, cheaper arming, self-tested honesty

Six hardening changes aimed at the friction that kept the core loop from feeling excellent. No
philosophy change: the deterministic content checks (sensor/anti-pattern blocks, stale anchors,
artifacts) are untouched — same diff, same verdict.

- **First run self-heals.** `hivelore doctor` now detects a **broken git hook** (one still calling the
  removed `haive` binary, or carrying a duplicate block — the states that abort every commit with
  `haive: not found`) and reports it as an error; `hivelore doctor --fix` repairs it in place
  (deterministic, foreign husky/custom hooks preserved). New exported `detectStaleGitHooks` /
  `repairStaleGitHooks` / `hookIsStale`, sharing one hook source-of-truth (`managedGitHookSpecs`).
- **Commit-time gate is advisory; sharing points enforce.** At `pre-commit`/`local` the PROCESS gates
  (briefing loaded, session recap, decision coverage, bootstrap) are warnings — only DETERMINISTIC
  content findings block a local commit. They enforce as errors at `pre-push`/`ci`, where the code
  leaves the machine. This removes the `--no-verify` reflex on cold/iterating repos without weakening
  what "same diff, same verdict" protects. (`enforcement.humanCommits="strict"` still binds humans at
  the sharing points.)
- **Silence on success.** A passing gate at commit/local prints **one line**, not a page of ✓; the
  full report is kept for CI, `--explain`, and the new `--verbose`. On a block, the lesson-refusal
  leads — no cold-repo score/process noise buried around it.
- **Cheaper sensor arming — mine the pattern from the fix.** `hivelore sensors propose <lesson>
  --from-fix <pre-fix-ref>` derives the regex from the fix diff itself: the line the fix **removed** is
  the mistake (`pattern`), the line it **added** is the correct marker (`absent`). Authoring a
  discriminating sensor becomes confirming a mined one — and it still runs the full validation
  (silent-on-current, fires-on-bad, not-inverted). New pure core `mineSensorSeedFromDiff`.
- **The validator self-tests.** `hivelore eval` now runs a **validation contract** (like the ranking
  tier contract) that exercises the installed validator against the deterministic-honesty invariants
  the block decision depends on — inverted-sensor rejection, false-RED rejection, fires-on-current
  rejection, no-backwards-seed. A reopened hole hard-fails eval in CI instead of shipping. New pure
  core `runValidationContract`.
- **Prevention is evidence-graded.** The prevention receipt (`hivelore stats receipt`) now separates
  blocks that stopped a **demonstrably-real** incident (red-proven, or incident-linked) from those
  enforcing a documented preference — `Evidence: K red-proven · M incident-linked · N documented-only`.
  Honest empirical grading, never inflated. New `PreventionReceipt.by_evidence` + row `evidence`.

## [0.52.1] — Idempotent git-hook regeneration (post-rename repair)

- **`enforce install` now REPLACES a stale hook block instead of appending a duplicate.** A repo
  installed before the v0.51.0 `haive`→`hivelore` rename kept `.git/hooks/{pre-commit,pre-push,
  commit-msg}` calling the removed `haive` binary directly; `enforce install` keyed idempotency on the
  *current* marker string, did not recognise the legacy `# hAIve enforcement hook` block, and appended
  the new probe below it — a two-block hook whose dead `haive` line ran first and aborted **every
  commit** with `haive: not found`. Hook regeneration now strips any Hivelore-owned block (current OR
  legacy hAIve shape, plus a previously-appended duplicate) and rewrites a single clean block. A
  genuinely foreign hook (husky/custom) is still preserved, with our block appended after it and no
  stray mid-script shebang. New pure, tested helpers `stripHiveloreHookBlock` / `buildHookFileContent`;
  regeneration is now a fixed point (re-running install never grows or duplicates the hook).

## [0.52.0] — Behaviour-harness honesty + inverted-sensor guard

Four hardening fixes concentrated on the branch Hivelore leads — no philosophy change, no new surface.

- **prove-RED no longer accepts a crash as a RED.** The replay classified *any* non-zero exit at
  `red_ref` as proof — so an oracle that errored before reaching its assertion (the guarded code/test
  doesn't exist yet at the pre-fix commit → `Cannot find module`, a `SyntaxError`, `no tests found`)
  was recorded `red_proven: true`, fabricating a guarantee. `proveRedOnIncident` now runs the failure
  output through the new pure `isHarnessErrorOutput` and returns `red-unrunnable` (proves nothing)
  instead — the same "unrunnable ≠ failed" honesty already applied on the current tree. A genuine
  assertion failure is still a real RED. **Conservative by design:** applied only to the prove-RED
  path, never the gate executor (over-classifying at the gate would demote a real block to a warn).
- **Inverted sensors are rejected.** A `block` regex proposal whose pattern matches the lesson's OWN
  recommended fix (its `Instead, use:` snippet) is refused with reason `fires-on-correct` — it would
  block the correct code and never the mistake. New `SensorSelfCheck.fires_on_correct` +
  `extractCorrectApproachExamples`; enforced in `propose_sensor`, the CLI `sensors propose`, and
  `sensors promote`. The flagship `moment`→`date-fns` flow is unaffected (the pattern targets the
  mistake, not the fix).
- **`memory tried` never suggests the recommended tool as the pattern.** The seed excluded the
  `Instead, use:` clause but not the recommendation when it leaked into the why-failed line
  ("team standard is date-fns" → seed `date-fns`, a sensor firing on the fix). Recommended tokens are
  now excluded from the fallback/assignment picks; with no faulty token left the seed is honestly
  `null` (author it yourself) rather than inverted. The "X without Y" companion trigger is untouched.
- **Behaviour coverage no longer vanishes on small repos.** `doctor`'s `behaviour-coverage` finding
  returned nothing when no main area could be derived (a single-package `src/` under the file
  threshold) — even with a red-proven oracle armed. It now still reports armed/red-proven oracle
  counts in that case, so the measure acknowledges protection wherever it exists.

## [0.51.0] — Kill `haive`: one name, with migration

The legacy `haive` name is retired across the user-visible surface. Migration is automatic and
non-destructive — a pre-rename repo keeps working and is converted on the next `hivelore init` /
`enforce install`.

- **Binary**: only `hivelore` (and `hivelore-mcp`) are installed now; the `haive` / `haive-mcp` bins are gone.
- **Config file**: `.ai/haive.config.json` → `.ai/hivelore.config.json`. The loader reads the legacy file
  as a fallback and migrates it (writes the new name, deletes the old) on the next save; `init` migrates
  proactively, preserving your settings.
- **Workflows**: `haive-sync.yml` / `haive-enforcement.yml` → `hivelore-*.yml`. Installing adopts the legacy
  managed block and removes the old file so CI never runs twice. Workflow env vars are now `HIVELORE_*`
  (readers still accept the legacy `HAIVE_*` baked into old workflows).
- **Git hooks** probe only `hivelore`; `hivelore dev link` no longer falls back to the legacy `@hiveai` scope.

Internal implementation names (some `HAIVE_*` runtime env plumbing, generated bridge filenames, internal
symbols) are unchanged for now and continue to work.


## [0.50.0] — Sharpen the surface, harden the gate

Concentrate on the un-copyable core; cut noise.

- **Fail-open hardened.** A `sensor-gate-errored` (the sensor machinery threw, so NO sensors were
  evaluated — the one way the deterministic layer silently goes dark) now **fails the build in CI**
  instead of a quiet warning. A green CI that evaluated no sensors is a lie about protection. Locally it
  stays non-blocking but is a loud, high-impact finding.
- **Fuzzy review matches off by default.** The aggregated "N documented lessons plausibly match — review"
  finding is hidden unless `enforcement.reviewMatches: true` (or `antiPatternGate: "review"`). It fired on
  nearly every commit and was skimmed past; only a deterministic sensor block is signal.
- **`hivelore doctor` hides informational findings by default** (`--all` to show them), keeping warn/error
  and the coverage metrics visible so the report stays actionable.
- **`hivelore release ship`** — one command for the release close-out: `git pull --rebase` → tag + push →
  poll CI via `enforce finish --wait`.


## [0.49.0] — Less ceremony, more gate

Cut friction so effort concentrates on the un-copyable core. No change touches the deterministic
sensor/block path.

- **Passive capture is silent until signal.** Failure distillation now always drops navigation/setup
  builtins (`cd`, `mkdir`, `echo`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `test`, …) and keeps a draft only when the failure
  *repeats* (a retry loop) or the command is substantive (test/build/typecheck/lint). A one-off ordinary
  failure — e.g. a `cd` into a missing dir — no longer becomes a proposed "lesson".
- **Decision memories only for the unguessable.** The `post_task` prompt now states the bar explicitly:
  for a routine change, capturing nothing is the correct outcome — a corpus of restated obvious facts
  makes every briefing worse.
- **Release papercut fixed.** `.ai/.usage/` (machine-local tool-usage telemetry, never team truth) is
  gitignored by `hivelore init`, so the working tree no longer goes dirty on every invocation.
- **Bootstrap gate bound to sharing points.** The first-agent bootstrap block now fires only at
  pre-push / CI / `enforce finish`; at pre-commit and local it is a warning. Quick local iteration and
  throwaway repos are no longer blocked (which trained `--no-verify`), while a cold repo still can't be
  shared without its baseline.


## [0.48.0] — Cheaper oracles: property-based and differential scaffolds

- `hivelore sensors scaffold` and the `scaffold_test` MCP tool gained a `--style` axis that lowers the
  cost of expressing the invariant the behaviour harness leaves to you — without any LLM guessing your
  assertion:
  - `--style property` generates a fast-check (vitest/jest) or Hypothesis (pytest) skeleton: state the
    invariant once and it is checked over many generated inputs. Names the subject from `--red-ref`
    hints and embeds the lesson's expected-fix text as the invariant comment.
  - `--style differential --reference <import>` generates a skeleton that asserts the subject *agrees*
    with a reference implementation for all generated inputs — no invariant to state at all.
- Every style stays a pending, fully-commented stub (the suite stays green) and arms through the same
  validated prove-RED path once filled in. New pure core API: `ScaffoldStyle`, `normalizeScaffoldStyle`,
  and the `style` / `reference` options on `scaffoldPostIncidentTest`. Go emits a gopter hint.


## [0.47.0] — Behaviour coverage closes the loop to action

- `hivelore doctor`'s `behaviour-coverage` finding now points at the exact next command for each
  uncovered area, not just a count. `assessBehaviourCoverage` gained `uncoveredAreaSuggestions`: for
  every uncovered area it finds a scaffoldable lesson (an anchored attempt/gotcha not yet a behavioural
  oracle, preferring incident-shaped `attempt`) and doctor prints
  `hivelore sensors scaffold <id> --red-ref <pre-fix-commit>   # guard <area>` in its Suggested
  commands — or a `memory tried … then scaffold` line when no lesson exists there yet. Measure → action.


## [0.46.0] — Oracle assist: scaffold the test around the fix

- `hivelore sensors scaffold` and the `scaffold_test` MCP tool gained `--red-ref` / `red_ref`. Given the
  pre-fix incident commit, the scaffold names the symbols the fix (`red_ref..HEAD`, scoped to the lesson's
  anchors) actually touched and pre-fills the commented example around them (`import { refund } …`,
  `expect(refund(…)).toBe(…)`) instead of a generic `subjectUnderTest()` — turning "fill the assertion"
  into a targeted edit. New pure core helper `incidentHintsFromDiff(diff)` does the extraction (tracks the
  enclosing function so a body-only change still names its function; const additions rank second).
- The enriched example stays a **pending, commented** stub (no live import) so the suite stays green, and
  the git diff is read without shell interpolation. A bad ref falls back to the generic template. This is a
  deterministic head-start, never an LLM inventing the assertion; `propose_sensor` remains the sole
  validated arming path.


## [0.45.0] — Behaviour-harness coverage metric

- The behaviour harness (command/test sensors routing a real oracle, optionally red-proven) now has a
  visible coverage metric. New pure core API `assessBehaviourCoverage({ memories, codeFiles })` reports,
  per main code area, whether a behavioural oracle guards it, how many are armed (`block`), and how many
  are red-proven — using the same area derivation as the bootstrap gate (`deriveMainAreas`, now shared).
- `hivelore doctor` surfaces it as an info finding in the Protection section
  ("Behaviour harness: X/N area(s) guarded (K armed, P red-proven)", naming uncovered areas), and the
  human `hivelore stats receipt` prints it as a one-line footer. Always info — the behaviour harness is
  opt-in, so this measures progress without nagging.


## [0.44.1] — Large-diff gate robustness

- Fixed a `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` that crashed the pre-commit gate (and blocked
  every commit with an unactionable message) on a very large staged diff — a staged `node_modules`, a
  generated megafile, or a lockfile. `stripAiDirHunks` / `stripTestHunks` now split hunks with a loop
  instead of `out.push(...block)`, which overflowed the call-argument limit on a single huge hunk.
- `hivelore sensors check` no longer fails silently (`git diff --cached … maxBuffer length exceeded`)
  on a multi-MB staged diff: the staged-diff reader now allows up to 256 MB.
- Capped the review-only fuzzy corroboration (literal token overlap + semantic embedding) at 20,000
  added lines, cutting a 200k-line diff from ~9 s to ~1.5 s. Anchored lessons and deterministic
  sensors — the block path — are never capped; above the cap the gate emits a `precommit-policy-notice`
  info finding ("did you stage node_modules?").
- `HIVELORE_DEBUG=1` now prints the full stack for a swallowed top-level error, so a crash deep in
  diff processing can be located instead of surfacing as a bare message.


## [0.44.0] — Harness correctness and evidence hardening

- Fixed manual `sensors check` parity for rule-only AST sensors and added stable JSON proposal
  verdicts across accepted and rejected CLI paths.
- Restricted `/hivelore remember` persistence to trusted repository members, made filenames
  collision-safe, regression-tested event authorization and existing-PR idempotence, and now commit
  the action bundle that release refs execute.
- Made `post_task.files_touched` protocol-compatible, bounded manual-session prevention receipts,
  and stopped eval/selftest probes from inflating real prevention outcomes.
- Added a fail-closed, real-embeddings semantic eval lane with its own committed baseline and CI model cache.
- Restored the documented optional semantic layer: base CLI/MCP installs no longer pull the heavy
  embeddings runtime transitively, while dynamic lexical fallback remains functional.
- Added active-MCP runtime version diagnostics, canonical indexing commands, Node 20 package engines,
  quieter actionable-only doctor output, auditable sensor-weakening approvals, and a ten-case
  independently-attested paired benchmark contract.


## [0.43.2]

- Made committed eval baselines portable: authored retrieval now ranks only shared team/module
  memories with deterministic anchor/lexical scoring, independent of personal usage and embeddings caches.
- Anchored benchmark and nested-reference policies to files present in clean clones, eliminating
  false stale-memory enforcement failures in CI.
- Documented and regression-tested sensor-weakening detection so a newly created discriminating
  sensor with `absent` is not misclassified as a suppression broadening.


## [0.43.1]

- Completed bootstrap coverage for the benchmark fixtures, nested Engram reference checkout, and
  GitHub Action with focused module contexts and anchored team knowledge.
- Added validated block sensors preventing unsupported benchmark superiority claims, Engram secret
  leakage, and execution of untrusted GitHub review text.
- Restored the strict finish gate after the new code-map exposed previously uncovered top-level areas.


## [0.43.0] — harness assurance: proven behaviour, structural rules, and review learning persistence

### Security
- Replaced shell-interpolated Git operations in prove-RED and HEAD-baseline reads with
  `execFileSync` argument arrays; hostile refs/paths can no longer trigger shell expansion.
- Blocking shell/test sensors now require a replayed pre-fix ref and persist `red_proven: true`.

### Added
- Full ast-grep Rule objects (`kind`, `inside`, `has`, `not`, `all`, `any`, …), explicit language
  selection, and optional Python/Go/Rust/Java parsers on the existing AST sensor surface.
- Strict policies for unrunnable command sensors and sensor weakening; this repo enables both.
- `/hivelore remember` can persist a proposed team memory on a dedicated review PR. Both review
  comments and top-level PR comments are ingested, and each learning proposes a golden eval case.
- `pnpm verify` is the build-first release chain: build, typecheck, tests, artifact verification,
  authored-case regression gate, and 100% deterministic sensor catch rate.
- Three dogfood guards: shell-interpolation AST protection plus RED-proven CI/verify command sensors.
- Benchmark evidence grading requires at least ten paired tasks with correctness, policy,
  duration, and token outcomes before comparative claims are marked decision-ready.

### Changed
- Eval baselines now store and compare the independently authored report when available instead of
  allowing self-synthesized corpus growth to create or hide regressions.
- CI runs the regression gate and requires 100% sensor catch rate.
- Sensor promotion refuses command/test oracles that have not proven RED.

### Fixed
- Prevention receipts treat legacy missing `prevented_count` values as zero instead of emitting
  `prevented_count_total: null`.
- Retired the obsolete separate-global-MCP lesson and refreshed active package sensors for the
  `@hivelore/*` namespace.


## [0.42.1] — eval that would have caught our own bugs (excellence plan, Phase 5)

> The self-synthesized eval scored 100/100 while the stack-pack ranking bug shipped. Golden cases
> now come from reality (gate misses), and a ranking tier CONTRACT guards the classifier's designed
> behavior in every repo's CI.

### Added
- **Gate misses propose golden eval cases.** When `sync` turns a revert of a gate-passed commit
  into a gate-miss lesson, it now ALSO appends a labeled retrieval case (task = the lesson's
  heading, expected = the lesson id) to `.ai/eval/spec.json` under `proposed_retrieval` — never
  scored until a human runs **`hivelore eval --approve-cases`**. Eval reports waiting cases out
  loud; approval is idempotent. (Core: `appendProposedRetrievalCases`, `approveProposedCases`.)
- **Ranking tier contract in every eval run** (`runTierContract`, core): the designed tier per
  memory category under fixed evidence — stack-pack rescue stays alive on strong evidence, the
  weak-evidence crowding guard stays, env workarounds keep the hard cap, anchors always win,
  negative knowledge ranks first. A violated check fails the eval run (exit non-zero) — this is
  exactly the family that would have caught the dead-escape-hatch ranking bug before release.

## [0.42.0] — the PR loop: review replies become proposed lessons (excellence plan, Phase 3)

> The git-native version of CodeRabbit's "Learnings" — with the step no inferential reviewer can
> take: a review learning can graduate into a deterministic blocking sensor.

### Added
- **`hivelore ingest --from github-pr <number|url|comments.json>`.** Pulls a PR's review-thread
  comments (via `gh api`, or a recorded JSON for offline/CI) and keeps HUMAN instructions —
  imperative shapes ("never/always/must/prefer/instead of") or the explicit
  `/hivelore remember` marker; bots, questions, and "LGTM" are dropped. Each kept thread becomes a
  `proposed` **convention** tagged `review-learning`, anchored to the thread's file, carrying PR/
  author/URL provenance, deduped per thread via the existing `ingest:` topic (idempotent re-runs;
  the latest reply in a thread wins). Pure converter in core (`extractReviewLearnings`,
  `reviewLearningsToDrafts`).
- **GitHub Action: `/hivelore remember` ack.** On `pull_request_review_comment` / `issue_comment`
  events, a reply starting with `/hivelore remember <rule>` gets an acknowledgment comment (the
  "learning captured" moment) with the ready-to-run `ingest --from github-pr` command. The Action
  never commits to the repo — persisting stays a deliberate, reviewable local step.

## [0.41.0] — passive capture: failures distill into proposed lessons (excellence plan, Phase 2)

> The claude-mem pipeline shape, finished on our own infra: the PostToolUse hook already observed
> failures; now `session end --auto` turns them into REVIEWABLE corpus candidates — no agent
> discipline required, no LLM, no new surface.

### Added
- **Auto-captured lesson drafts.** `session end --auto` (the SessionEnd hook path) clusters the
  session's failure observations (`distillFailureObservations`, core: retries collapse, exploratory
  lookups dropped, capped at 3/session) and writes each as a `proposed` **attempt** tagged
  `auto-captured`, anchored to the observed files, deduped against existing attempts and across
  re-runs. Boundaries: deterministic templating only, born `proposed` (never validated), never a
  sensor; autopilot's 72h time-based auto-approve explicitly SKIPS `auto-captured` drafts.
- **The nag now points at the drafts.** `uncaptured-failures` (enforce finish) and the auto-recap's
  discoveries list the waiting drafts ("review/approve or reject") instead of asking the agent to
  re-type what the harness already observed.
- **Hook-less agents feed the same stream.** `hivelore run --` records a failure observation when
  the wrapped agent exits non-zero, so wrapper-mode sessions distill too.

## [0.40.0] — AST sensors: structural precision via ast-grep (excellence plan, Phase 1)

> Reuse over build: the industry-best static rule mechanism (ast-grep structural patterns) becomes a
> sensor kind, while everything that makes Hivelore unique — provenance + deterministic validation —
> stays. The regex engine remains the dependency-free default.

### Added
- **`kind: ast` sensors** (`sensors propose --kind ast --pattern '<ast-grep pattern>'`,
  `propose_sensor kind:"ast"`). Structural matching on the AST of changed files: comments and string
  literals can never false-positive (the regex engine's known weakness), `absent` is checked INSIDE
  the matched node (structural sub-pattern, text fallback for property keys). Fires only when a
  match intersects the diff's added lines — introduction, not presence (`addedLineNumbersFromDiff`
  in core). Validation transposes unchanged: silent-on-current (HEAD), fires-on-bad-example,
  anti-brittleness; a block proposal is rejected when the engine is missing (`ast-engine-missing`) —
  an unvalidatable guard must not claim to block.
- **Optional engine, honest degradation.** `@ast-grep/napi` ships as an optionalDependency
  (cli + mcp, tsup externals per the documented gotcha). Without it: gate warns
  `ast-sensor-unrunnable` (never blocks), `sensors check` reports the count, doctor says how to
  install (`ast-engine-missing`). TS/TSX/JS built in; other languages via `@ast-grep/lang-*`.

## [0.39.3] — behaviour hardening: prove the RED, contain the execution (excellence plan, Phase 4)

### Added
- **Prove-RED arming** (`sensors propose --red-ref <ref>` / `propose_sensor red_ref`). GREEN on the
  current tree cannot distinguish "the test catches the incident" from "the test passes on
  everything". `red_ref` (the pre-fix commit) is replayed in a scratch `git worktree` (main tree's
  `node_modules` symlinked in) and the oracle must FAIL there. Success records `red_proven: true`
  on the sensor and shows `✓ RED-proven` in the prevention receipt; a block proposal whose oracle
  passes on the incident state is rejected (`red-not-proven`), an unrunnable replay proves nothing
  (`red-unrunnable`), a bad ref is `red-ref-invalid`. Without `red_ref`, behavior is unchanged —
  the acceptance guidance now suggests it.

### Changed
- **Command sensors run env-scrubbed** (gate executor + validation): a repo-authored oracle gets a
  test-runner environment (PATH/HOME/locale/TMP/CI + `NODE_*`/`npm_*`/`NVM_*`/`LC_*`/`HIVELORE_*`),
  not the caller's credentials — cloud keys and tokens are no longer visible to sensor commands.
  Pure allowlist in core (`scrubbedCommandEnv`).

## [0.39.2] — stack-pack seeds rank when the task is squarely theirs

> Root-caused from the v0.39.1 gauntlet: on a freshly seeded Nest+Next+Prisma repo, the task
> "add a prisma migration" left `prisma-migrations-never-modify` in `background`
> (briefing thin, useful=0) — the single most relevant lesson hidden by its own origin tag.

### Fixed
- **Stack-pack rescue on strong task evidence.** The briefing down-rank that keeps generic seeds
  from crowding out repo-specific knowledge had a dead escape hatch: it only lifted seeds with a
  direct anchor, but stack packs ship anchor-less (`needs_anchor`), so they could NEVER rank above
  background. In the shared classifier (`classifyMemoryPriority`, one source of truth for CLI and
  MCP), a stack seed with an **exact/literal task hit or strong semantic relevance (cosine ≥ 0.65)**
  now ranks `useful` — never `must_read`. Weak evidence (tag hits, mid semantic) is still smothered,
  and env-workaround memories keep the unconditional cap. Threshold calibrated on live scores: the
  on-topic pack memory measured 0.688–0.755 vs ≤ 0.60 for off-topic neighbours.

> Fixes from a full gauntlet of the installed v0.39.0 — no new surface, the existing one made truthful.

### Fixed
- **A pending oracle can no longer arm a block sensor** (`oracle-pending` rejection). A scaffolded
  stub (`it.todo`/skip) passes on anything, so `sensors propose --kind test` used to accept it and
  report protection that enforced nothing. `propose_sensor` now extracts the test files referenced
  by the command and rejects a `block` proposal while any is still pending; `warn` is accepted with
  an explicit pending-stub note. (Core: `hasPendingTestMarker`, `extractTestFilePathsFromCommand`.)
- **Bootstrap gate now credits glob-scoped BLOCK sensors.** Stack packs ship anchor-less memories
  with glob sensor scopes (`**/*.controller.ts`), so `init` reported "N sensors active" while the
  bootstrap checklist claimed the same areas had "no guardrail". A validated block sensor whose
  scope matches an area's files now closes that area's `sensor-coverage` gap; warn sensors still
  don't count (they cannot block a repeat).
- **Doctor output polish**: the trailing command list is now titled "Suggested commands" (it
  duplicated the "Next actions" findings header), and prose fixes are prefixed `→` instead of a
  misleading shell `$`.
- **`mem_tried` slug hygiene**: the permanent id can no longer end on a connective after the 5-word
  cut (`…-contract-drift-between-api-and` → `…-contract-drift-between-api`).

## [0.39.0] — gate-surface integrity + behaviour-loop accounting

> Six hardening steps from a full harness audit: the gate now watches its own surface (a diff that
> weakens a sensor is called out), never fails dark, explains its score, keeps enforced lessons
> team-scoped, nudges open behaviour loops closed, and scaffolds multi-package lessons properly.

### Added
- **`sensor-weakened` review finding** (`enforce check` / `ci`, all `antiPatternGate` modes incl.
  `off`). The gate lives in `.ai/` — the same tree the agent it constrains can edit. A staged diff
  that demotes a block sensor to warn, changes/removes its oracle (`pattern`/`command`), broadens
  its `absent` suppression, deletes the sensor block, or deletes a memory carrying a block sensor
  now surfaces a warn finding naming each change. Review-only, never blocks (legitimate demotions
  exist); removing `absent` TIGHTENS a sensor and never flags. Pure detector:
  `detectSensorWeakening` in `@hivelore/core`.
- **`post-incident-test-unarmed` nudge** (doctor + `enforce finish`, warn, zero score impact). A
  scaffolded post-incident test whose assertion is still pending (`it.todo`/skip), or whose lesson
  has no armed shell/test sensor, is an OPEN behaviour loop — the incident is documented but nothing
  deterministic guards it. Cross-checked via the scaffold's provenance marker
  (`assessScaffoldLoop` in core; collector scans `incidents/` directories).
- **Multi-package scaffolds.** A lesson whose anchors span several packages now scaffolds **one
  pending test per owning package** (framework and location per package) instead of "first anchor
  wins" — in both `hivelore sensors scaffold` and the `scaffold_test` MCP tool (new `scaffolds[]`
  in the output). A memory carries ONE sensor, so all generated tests share a single
  `propose_command` whose oracle chains every run command (`… && …`).

### Changed
- **Enforced lessons default to team scope.** `mem_tried` with a one-shot `sensor` (MCP and
  `hivelore memory tried --sensor-*`) now defaults `scope` to **team** instead of personal: a
  sensor on a personal (gitignored) memory only guards the machine that captured it. An explicit
  scope always wins. `propose_sensor` additionally nudges promotion whenever an accepted sensor
  lands on a personal memory.
- **The enforcement score names its top penalties.** `enforcement-score-below-threshold` now reads
  `… below required threshold 85% — top penalties: sensor-block (−45), …` instead of an unexplained
  percentage.
- **The sensor gate never fails dark.** An internal error in the gate's sensor machinery used to
  silently skip ALL sensors (fail-open); it now emits a `sensor-gate-errored` warn finding saying
  protection is off until fixed — still never blocks a commit on harness breakage.

## [0.38.0] — scaffold_test MCP tool + monorepo-aware framework detection

> Two follow-ups to post-incident scaffolding: agents can scaffold in-session, and detection is
> monorepo-aware.

### Added
- **`scaffold_test` MCP tool** (enforcement profile). The in-session mirror of `hivelore sensors
  scaffold`: an agent goes from a captured lesson to a pending post-incident test without leaving the
  conversation. Writes the stub (or previews with `write: false`), returns `run_command` +
  `propose_command`, refuses to clobber an existing file, and — like the CLI — **never arms a
  sensor** (`propose_sensor` stays the sole validated writer).

### Changed
- **Monorepo-aware framework detection.** Scaffolding now detects the test framework and file
  location from the package that OWNS the lesson's anchor paths, not the repo root: a lesson under
  `packages/api/` scaffolds a test into `packages/api/tests/incidents/…` using that package's
  framework. `detectTestFrameworkForPaths` walks up from each anchor path to the nearest enclosing
  manifest (`package.json` / `go.mod` / a python signal).
- **Single shared detector.** Framework detection is now one implementation: the pure decision
  (`pickTestFramework` / `normalizeFramework`) lives in `@hivelore/core`, the FS walking in
  `@hivelore/mcp`, and the CLI imports it — removing the CLI's duplicate detector.


## [0.37.0] — post-incident test scaffolding — mem_tried → sensors scaffold → command sensor

> The behaviour bridge's on-ramp. A command sensor needs a test to route as its oracle — and someone
> has to write it. This release generates that test from the lesson, closing the loop
> `mem_tried → sensors scaffold → (write assertion) → propose --kind test`.

### Added
- **`hivelore sensors scaffold <memory-id>`.** Turns an attempt/gotcha lesson into a PENDING test
  file the team fills in, then arms as a command-sensor oracle. It:
  - detects the repo's test framework (vitest / jest / pytest / go; `--framework` to override),
  - writes a stub whose header carries the incident's provenance (memory id, incident, why, expected),
    with the test left pending (`it.todo` / `@pytest.mark.skip` / `t.Skip`) so the suite stays green
    until you write the assertion,
  - prints the exact `sensors propose --kind test --command "<runner> <path>"` line to arm it.
  - `--out` / `--stdout` / `--force` for placement and preview; refuses to clobber an existing file.
- The generator (`scaffoldPostIncidentTest`, `parseLessonFields`, `lessonShortName` in
  `@hivelore/core`) is pure and unit-tested; the CLI owns framework detection and file writing.

### Changed
- **`hivelore memory tried` nudges toward a real test.** When a regex can't express the mistake, the
  output points to `sensors scaffold <id>` as the behaviour-bridge path.

### Notes
- Scaffolding **never arms a sensor** — `propose_sensor` stays the sole validated writer (silent on
  current code, fires on the bad example). The stub is deliberately pending so an empty test can't
  masquerade as a passing oracle.


## [0.36.0] — positioning: enforcement-first top-line, incident→test provenance, shareable receipt, cold-repo gate headline

> A positioning-driven release: sharpen the wedge (Hivelore is the deterministic policy gate, not a
> memory layer), push the behaviour-harness story forward (link a lesson to the incident its test
> guards), make the prevention receipt a growth loop, and fix the cold-repo first impression.

### Added
- **Incident provenance on sensors (behaviour-harness increment).** A sensor can carry an optional
  `incident` ref (ticket / prod id). It surfaces at the gate (`↩ guards incident: prod #442`) and in
  the prevention receipt (`↩ incident: …`), turning "a test failed" into "this reproduces the
  incident the test exists to prevent" — the link a plain CI test can't express. Set it via
  `hivelore sensors propose --incident`, `propose_sensor`, or the `mem_tried` sensor block. Provenance
  lives on the committed sensor frontmatter (team truth); the receipt derives it by lookup, so
  `PreventionEvent` is unchanged and old logs stay valid.
- **`hivelore stats receipt --share`.** Emits a Markdown block ready to paste into Slack or a PR —
  incident provenance included, plus a subtle Hivelore attribution footer so shared proof markets the
  tool. An empty window renders a forward CTA (turn a past incident into a guardrail) instead of a
  dead zero, so the receipt is useful on day one. The CI PR comment carries the same attribution.

### Changed
- **Positioning leads with enforcement.** The README top-line, CLI root description, and package
  descriptions now lead with "the deterministic policy gate for agent-written code"; memory is framed
  as the substrate, not the pitch — differentiating from the crowded agent-memory market where no tool
  enforces.
- **Blocked-gate output leads with a headline.** `enforce check` now says WHY it blocked in one line:
  a content catch (`sensor-block` / `precommit-policy-block`) → "🛡️ A documented lesson refused this
  commit — about the change you just made" (naming the memory id); only setup/baseline gates → "⚙
  Setup gate — about your repo's baseline, not the change you just made." Fixes the cold-repo first
  impression where a real sensor block was buried among bootstrap/score noise.


## [0.35.1] — quarantine keeps its promise — promoted_at, durable gate-miss drafts

> Verification pass on 0.35.0 (review + fresh e2e on sandbox repos). The three features work as
> specced; three defects found at the seams, all fixed here.

### Fixed
- **`sensors promote` actually ends a quarantine.** Promoting a fixed oracle back to `block` was a
  no-op: the pre-promotion flaps were still inside the 30-day ledger window, so the next commit
  re-flagged `sensor-flaky` and the next `sync` re-demoted to warn — for up to 30 days. The sensor
  now records `promoted_at` on promotion and health assessment (gate, sensors check, sync, doctor)
  ignores evaluations at or before it. New flaps after promotion still quarantine normally.
- **Gate-miss drafts no longer eat themselves.** Drafts were anchored to the REVERT commit's file
  list — including files the revert just deleted and `.ai/` corpus files — so the very next `sync`
  marked them stale (invisible to doctor and briefings). Anchor candidates now exclude `.ai/` and
  paths that no longer exist on disk; a draft with no surviving path stays unanchored.
- **Gate-miss sensor hints are no longer shared junk.** The seed was extracted from the draft's own
  boilerplate ("Subject:", the generated why_failed sentence), producing the same useless pattern
  for every draft. It is now derived from the commit subject only, falling back to the honest
  "inspect the revert diff" text.


## [0.35.0] — the self-auditing gate — flaky quarantine, prevention receipts, gate-miss drafts

Hivelore's gate now audits its own reliability, learns deterministically from misses, and makes its
prevented-work value visible. All runtime evidence stays local under `.ai/.runtime/`; only reviewed
conclusions change the shared corpus.

### Sensor trust
- **Rolling sensor evaluation ledger.** Every regex/shell/test evaluation records fired, silent, or
  unrunnable outcome, stage, HEAD, duration/exit code, and a SHA-256 of scoped file contents. The
  best-effort NDJSON ledger rolls from 10,000 to the newest 8,000 rows and can never break a commit.
- **Flaky command sensors quarantine themselves.** Two fired↔silent transitions on identical scoped
  content within 30 days immediately downgrade a block to warn in memory; `hivelore sync` persists
  the demotion and one idempotent quarantine note. `doctor`/the gate show `sensor-flaky`; 20+ silent
  evaluations across 30+ days show `sensor-never-fired`. Manual `sensors promote` clears quarantine.

### Prevention receipts
- **`hivelore stats receipt [--since 7d] [--json]`.** Aggregates the prevention event log, usage
  counters, memory titles, sensor metadata, and current-vs-previous window trend into Slack-ready
  text or a stable JSON object.
- **One PR receipt comment.** Generated enforcement workflows capture this run's sensor findings,
  always upsert `<!-- haive:prevention-receipt -->` on pull requests, show the weekly totals, and
  silently skip when the token, PR permissions, or `gh` are unavailable. The original gate status
  is restored after commenting, so reporting never masks a failure.

### Gate-miss learning loop
- **Incremental git watch during `hivelore sync`.** The first run initializes at HEAD; later syncs
  scan only the saved SHA..HEAD range for existing deterministic revert/hotfix signals. Each new
  signal creates one deduplicated `status: proposed`, `gate-miss` lesson with commit/path provenance.
- **Gate-pass cross-reference.** Successful pre-commit/CI runs write a synthetic local ledger row.
  Reverting one of those SHAs annotates the draft that the gate passed it and includes a
  `proposed_sensor_seed` hint; nothing is auto-validated or auto-blocking. `doctor` lists pending
  gate-miss drafts for human review.

### Tests
- Added pure ledger/flap/window/receipt/git-watch tests plus CLI E2E coverage for alternating
  command-oracle quarantine and re-promotion, receipt aggregation/workflow generation, and the full
  pass-A → revert-B → one proposed gate-miss → idempotent second-sync loop.


## [0.34.1] — typecheck fix for the first-hour release

- Fix a `tsc --noEmit` error in the 0.34.0 init report initializer (`bridgeTargets: []` inferred as
  `never[]`). Runtime behavior unchanged; 0.34.0's CI was red on type-check only. Publish this one.


## [0.34.0] — the first hour — init that respects your machine, your stack, and your readme

> Field-tested the published package on fresh clones of express and vite. The gate engine held;
> every defect found was in the first hour of a new user's experience. This release fixes all of them.

### Changed
- **Bridges: generate for the agents you actually use.** `hivelore init` default moved from all 12
  bridge files to `--bridge-targets auto`: clients detected via machine signals (`~/.claude`,
  `~/.cursor`, `~/.gemini`, `~/.continue`, windsurf/zed/aider configs, VS Code extensions for
  copilot/cline/roo/cody), the currently-running agent's env vars, and bridge files already in the
  repo — plus AGENTS.md always (the cross-tool standard). On a typical machine that is ~5 files at
  the repo root instead of 14. `--bridge-targets all` restores the old behavior; the Cursor MCP
  nudge rule is only written when cursor is a target. The init report lists the actual targets.
- **Stack detection ignores fixture universes.** Nested-manifest scanning skips
  playground/examples/fixtures/e2e/demo/bench/sandbox dirs, `template-*`-style scaffolding families,
  and doc sites (docs/website — VitePress→vue, Docusaurus→react are the docs' stack, not the
  product's). On the vite repo this cuts seeding from 6 irrelevant stacks (react, vue, tailwind,
  express…) to exactly vite + typescript. Real monorepos (apps/web with next, apps/api with nest)
  still detect fully.
- **Stack-pack seeds are never auto-anchored.** The corpus auto-fix matched export names against
  generic seed prose and anchored a React useEffect gotcha to a docs data file on a non-React repo.
  Seeds now stay unanchored/background until someone anchors them deliberately; normal memories keep
  the auto-anchor fix.

### Fixed
- **The first suggested command works now.** init's closing hint printed
  `hivelore memory import README.md` — missing the required `--from`, blind to the file's actual
  casing (express ships `Readme.md`), and printed even when no readme exists. init and the
  bootstrap template now detect the real filename case-insensitively, print
  `memory import --from <file> --changelog` (direct, no AI) vs `--from <file>` (AI-client prompt)
  honestly, and stay silent when the file is absent. Same fix for the bootstrap README excerpt.
- **Corrupt memory files are no longer silently invisible.** A memory with broken frontmatter was
  skipped without any signal — a lost team lesson. `loadMemoriesFromDirDetailed` (core) reports
  parse failures and `hivelore doctor` surfaces them as `invalid-memory-files` (warn) with the path
  and the YAML error.
- **Stale references to removed surface.** doctor and get_briefing hints no longer recommend
  `mem_observe` (removed in 0.32.0); the runtime README no longer mentions `runtime_journal_append`;
  doctor's stale-memory fix no longer suggests the removed `memory edit`.
- **One code-map option set.** autopilot repair and `index code` hand-rolled shorter exclude lists
  (re-including test dirs) than init/sync; all callers now extend the exported
  `CODE_MAP_DEFAULT_EXCLUDE` baseline, so successive code-maps agree on which files exist.

### Tests
- +11 tests (684 total): findDocFile casing, bridge detection (machine/env/repo-file signals, bare-
  machine fallback), seed non-anchoring vs normal-memory anchoring, detailed loader on corrupt files.


## [0.33.0] — the behaviour bridge — command sensors route your own tests to lessons

> The three-harness table said "Behaviour: ⛔ out of scope". This release moves it to 🟡 Bridged —
> without touching the oracle problem: Hivelore does not generate tests or judge outputs, it routes
> the oracle the team ALREADY OWNS (an existing test, an invariant script) to the lesson it protects,
> and the gate executes it deterministically. Verified e2e: a pure behaviour bug (clean code no regex
> can see) is refused at commit with the oracle's output in the finding.

#### Added
- **One-shot behaviour capture**: `hivelore memory tried --sensor-command "npx vitest run …"`
  (MCP: `mem_tried` with `sensor.kind: "shell"|"test"` + `command` + `timeout_ms`) — lesson and
  executable oracle attached in a single call.
- **`propose_sensor` / `sensors propose --kind shell|test --command …`**: command proposals are
  validated before being trusted — the oracle must PASS on the presumed-correct current tree
  (`fails-on-current` rejection), and an unrunnable command is its own rejection reason.
- **Shared executor** (`utils/command-sensors.ts`): per-sensor `timeout_ms` (default 120s), output
  tail captured into findings, and the critical distinction — a command that RAN and failed enforces
  at the sensor's severity; an UNRUNNABLE command (127/126/timeout) surfaces as
  `command-sensor-unrunnable` (warn) and never blocks: a broken harness must not masquerade as a
  failing test. Wired into the gate (pre-commit + CI) and `sensors check --commands`.
- Gate findings now show the failing oracle's exit code, duration, and output tail — the agent sees
  WHICH assertion broke without re-running anything.

#### Unchanged (the honesty rules)
- Command execution stays **opt-in per repo** (`enforcement.runCommandSensors: true`) — it runs
  repo-authored commands and is never enabled globally by Hivelore.
- No test generation, no sandbox platform, no LLM-as-judge: full behaviour verification remains the
  test suite's job. README three-harness table updated (⛔ → 🟡 Bridged).


## [0.32.0] — surface reduction — 67→55 command files, one verb per job

> Field verdict after weeks of dogfooding: the surface had outgrown a solo maintainer. Everything
> a daily user needs stays; duplicates and the unused long tail go. All old spellings keep working
> as hidden aliases — nothing breaks, the help just stops advertising two names for one job.

#### Removed (unused / off-mission; resurrect from git history if ever needed)
- CLI: `snapshot` (API-contract snapshots — behaviour-harness territory, explicitly out of scope),
  `playback`, `welcome`, `hub`, `tui` (the ink/react interactive dashboard — `dashboard`/`stats`
  cover it; drops ink+react from the CLI bundle), `runtime journal`.
- MCP experimental tools: `mem_observe`, `why_this_file`, `why_this_decision`, `mem_conflicts_with`,
  `pattern_detect`, `runtime_journal_append/tail` — usage logs showed ONE call across all of them
  in two months. `HAIVE_TOOL_PROFILE=experimental`/`full` remain as aliases of `maintenance`.

#### Merged (one verb per job; old names = hidden aliases)
- `install-hooks` → **`enforce install`** (single hook generator at last: pre-commit, pre-push,
  commit-msg + post-merge/post-rewrite sync; `--claude-scope`, `--claude-settings`, `--remove-claude`).
- `memory import-changelog` → `memory import --changelog [--package --versions]`.
- `memory seed-git` → `memory seed --git [--apply --limit --days]`.
- `memory hot` → `memory stats --hot [--threshold]`; `memory timeline` removed (MCP `mem_timeline` remains).
- `memory suggest-topic` → `memory suggest --topic <title> --type <type>`.
- `memory edit` → `memory update <id> --edit [-e <editor>]`.
- `memory conflict-candidates` + `memory resolve-conflict` → **`memory conflicts [<a> <b>] [--yes]`**.
- `memory pending` → `memory list --pending`.
- `memory for-files` and `memory auto-promote` removed (`briefing --files` and `sync` cover them).
- `embeddings index|query|status` → **`index memories|query|status`** next to `index code`
  (hidden `embeddings` family alias kept).

Net: 67 → 55 command files (−3,358 net lines), root commands 38 → 31, `memory` subcommands 31 → 20,
MCP tools 37 → 30, CLI bundle sheds ink/react. File formats, hooks contracts, VS Code extension
calls, and the MCP enforcement profile are untouched.


## [0.31.0] — kill the rituals — one-shot guardrails, release verbs, fatigue guard, token diet

> Driven by multi-session dogfooding ("what would make Hivelore irresistible"): remove the
> ceremonies a daily user repeats, stop warning fatigue before it teaches people to skim,
> and cut briefing token cost. A scan of awesome-harness-engineering confirmed the direction
> (half the ecosystem is token-reduction; nobody else closes the lesson→enforcement loop).

#### Added
- **One-shot loop close**: `mem_tried` accepts a `sensor` parameter (pattern/absent/severity/
  bad_example) that runs the full propose_sensor validation inline — capture the lesson AND
  attach the validated guardrail in a single call. CLI: `memory tried --sensor-pattern …
  [--sensor-absent … --sensor-severity block --bad-example …]`. The CLI command now delegates
  to the shared mem_tried handler (killed a 60-line duplication).
- **`hivelore release bump <patch|minor|major|X.Y.Z>`** — lockstep-bumps the 5 publishable
  manifests + scaffolds the CHANGELOG section; **`hivelore release tag`** — verifies lockstep +
  clean tree + not-already-tagged, creates `vX.Y.Z`, pushes branch and that one tag.
- **`enforce finish --wait [--wait-timeout N]`** — polls GitHub Actions for HEAD instead of
  failing on pending CI (replaces the manual `gh run watch` loop in the exit protocol).
- **Repeat-warning fatigue guard**: the aggregated `anti-pattern-review` finding lists only ids
  NOT shown in the last 24h; repeats collapse into "+N shown recently" (runtime-local debounce,
  count unchanged, `hivelore precommit` still lists everything).
- **Briefing token diet**: in `get_briefing` (format full), `background` memories ship as
  one-line pointers (`mem_get(id)` away) whenever the briefing has direct hits — a cold-start
  briefing dropped from ~3.7k to ~1.4k tokens in the field test. Thin briefings keep full bodies.
- **Near-duplicate hint on re-seed**: `init` warns when a seeded stack lesson likely duplicates
  an existing hand-written memory (points at `memory conflict-candidates` / `resolve-conflict`).
- Cold-start feedback: the first briefing on a large repo announces the one-time semantic code
  index build on stderr instead of silently hanging ~40s.

#### Fixed
- **Glob sensor scopes were silently dead** (`sensorAppliesToPath` did pure prefix matching):
  every `**/*.controller.ts`-style pack sensor never fired anywhere. Glob scopes now match.
- **Seeded stack sensors are pinned repo-wide (`["**"]`)**: the memory-anchor fallback was
  silently narrowing stack-wide rules ("never `$disconnect()` in serverless") to the single
  exemplar file the seed got anchored to.
- **CLI/MCP parity**: `hivelore briefing` now infers modules and loads module contexts like the
  MCP `get_briefing` (the CLI JSON omitted them entirely — module rules never reached CLI flows).
- `doctor` on an uninitialized directory prints a clear message instead of meaningless health scores.
- Retired the obsolete high-max-memories briefing ritual: the gotcha memory documenting it now
  says autoBrief covers it, and its sensor (which nagged every diff mentioning "decision-coverage"
  with outdated advice) was removed.


## [0.30.1] — process gates bind agents, not humans

> Field feedback from the 0.30.0 test pass: `briefing-missing` blocked a HUMAN committing by hand.
> The process gates encode the agent workflow contract ("consult team knowledge before changing
> code"); a human is the trusted author of that knowledge.

#### Added
- **Agent-context detection** (`detectAgentContext`, @hivelore/core): identifies agent harnesses
  from the environment (Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex, Aider, the `hivelore run` wrapper
  via `HAIVE_SESSION_ID`/`HAIVE_AGENT=1`); `HAIVE_AGENT=0` force-overrides to human.
- **`enforcement.humanCommits: "relaxed" | "strict"`** (default `relaxed`): when no agent harness
  is detected at pre-commit/pre-push, the PROCESS gates (briefing-missing, session-recap-missing,
  decision-coverage-missing, bootstrap-incomplete) downgrade to warnings with an explanatory note.
  DETERMINISTIC gates (block sensors, anti-pattern blocks, stale anchors, artifact hygiene) still
  bind everyone, and CI is unaffected. The gate header now names the actor:
  `strict · agent (claude-code)` vs `strict · human — process gates relaxed`.

Verified: human clean commit without briefing → passes with a warning; human reintroducing a
sensor-blocked pattern → still refused (exit 2); agent (Claude Code detected) without briefing →
still refused (exit 2).

## [0.30.0] — hAIve is now Hivelore

> One name everywhere: the brand, the binary, the npm scope, and the GitHub repo are now
> **Hivelore** (`hivelore`, `@hivelore/*`, `github.com/Doucs91/hivelore`). The old naming had
> three spellings (hAIve / @hiveai / haive) and two live collisions (HaiVE.tech, Hive AI /
> thehive.ai); `haive.dev`/`.ai` and the bare `haive` npm name were already taken.

#### Changed (rename — backwards compatible)
- **npm packages**: `@hiveai/{core,cli,mcp,embeddings}` → `@hivelore/{core,cli,mcp,embeddings}`.
  The `@hiveai/*` packages stay on npm (deprecated, pointing here); no further releases there.
- **Binaries**: the CLI installs `hivelore` (primary) **and** `haive` (legacy alias) — existing
  git hooks, MCP configs, and wrappers that call `haive` keep working unchanged.
  Same for `hivelore-mcp` / `haive-mcp`.
- **MCP**: server identity is `hivelore`; generated client configs write the `"hivelore"` server
  key (an existing `"haive"` key is recognized and left alone at user level; project-level
  configs are upgraded in place). Generated hooks resolve `hivelore` first, then legacy `haive`.
- **VS Code extension**: `hivelore.hivelore-vscode` (settings + commands under `hivelore.*`).
- **Docs**: README repositioned around the one-line promise and a copy-paste
  "60-second proof" that shows a captured lesson refusing a commit.

#### Unchanged (file formats — no migration needed in your repos)
- The `.ai/` directory, `haive.config.json`, `haive-*.yml` workflow names, bridge marker comments
  (`<!-- haive:… -->`), `merge=haive` git driver key, `HAIVE_*` environment variables, and MCP
  tool names all stay as-is. A repo initialized with hAIve works with Hivelore without any change.

#### Migration (only if you want the new names)
1. `npm i -g @hivelore/cli` (replaces the global install; both binaries land on PATH).
2. Optionally rename the `"haive"` key in your MCP client configs to `"hivelore"` and point
   `command` at `hivelore` — or leave it; the alias keeps working.
3. `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Doucs91/hivelore.git` (the old URL redirects).

## [0.29.13] — deterministic gate: only a validated sensor hard-blocks

> The v0.29.12 release commit passed the local gate at 95% and hard-blocked on GitHub Actions at
> 50% — same diff, same corpus. Root cause: the last non-deterministic block path (sensor-less
> memory + semantic ≥ 0.75) depends on cosine scores that vary per environment (fresh model
> download, runtime, warmup). A gate that answers differently per machine trains agents to bypass
> it — determinism IS the product promise of the feedback layer.

#### Changed
- **Hard-blocking is now sensor-only** (`classifyWarning`, precommit-check.ts): a sensor-less
  memory never blocks, even on a very strong semantic match — it surfaces as `review` with a
  rationale pointing at `propose_sensor`. The anchored gate keeps every other precision rule
  (personal-scope veto, sensor veto, distinctive-token analysis) for review/info tiering.
- **Prevention outcomes are sensor-only too** (`isHardBlockCatch`, anti-patterns-check.ts) — the
  "prevented mistakes" metric only counts what the gate would actually block.
- README "What block means" rewritten around the determinism rule.

#### Fixed
- **`precommit-policy-block` now names the culprits** — blocking memory ids (with reasons and
  sensor severity) and stale-anchor ids are in the finding message and `memory_ids`. The v0.29.12
  CI failure was undebuggable from the workflow log ("1 blocking anti-pattern", no id).

## [0.29.12] — the gate stops swallowing review warnings; sensor proposals validate against HEAD

> From a full end-to-end dogfooding pass on a fresh repo: the commit gate reported a clean pass
> while `hivelore precommit` was showing "you are about to repeat a documented failed approach".
> Review-tier knowledge must be VISIBLE at the gate (without blocking), and closing the
> lesson→sensor loop must work at the exact moment agents actually do it.

#### Fixed
- **`enforce check` now surfaces review-tier anti-patterns** as a single aggregated
  `anti-pattern-review` warn finding (bounded impact 5, never blocks). Previously
  `runPrecommitPolicy` dropped every non-blocking warning from `preCommitCheck`, so the hook/CI
  path reported `precommit-policy-pass` at 100% while an anchored attempt matched the diff.
  Aggregation (not one finding per warning) keeps the score impact bounded — the strict per-warning
  variant is exactly what 2026-05-07-attempt-strict-precommit-gate-on-haive documents as noise.
- **`propose_sensor` / `sensors propose|promote` self-checks now validate against HEAD**, not the
  working tree (new shared `readPresumedCorrectTargets`, exported from `@hivelore/mcp`). The realistic
  sequence — write bad code, hit the failure, `mem_tried`, propose the sensor, THEN revert — was
  impossible: the uncommitted bad pattern made every honest block proposal fail `fires-on-current`.
  HEAD is the last gated (presumed-correct) baseline; non-git dirs and new files fall back to the
  working tree.
- **`pre_commit_check` `affected_files` now points at the anchored code files**, never at
  `.ai/code-map.json` / bridges staged alongside (the repair hint sent agents to the wrong file).
- **`briefing_quality` no longer says `noisy` when a must_read matched**: a direct anchored hit is
  the product working; background-seed domination stays in `reasons`. (MCP + CLI kept in sync.)
- **`memory lint` no longer flags stack-pack seeds with MISSING_ANCHOR** (they carry
  `stack-pack` + `needs_anchor` tags and are unanchorable by nature); first-run output shows real
  findings instead of seed noise.

#### Added
- **CLI flag suggestions**: `showSuggestionAfterError` on the root program (inherited by all
  subcommands) — `--bodi` now answers "Did you mean --body?". Plus hidden synonyms for the two
  flags agents reliably guess: `memory save --content` → `--body`,
  `session end --summary` → `--accomplished` (hidden from help; documented flags stay the API).

## [0.29.0] — agent-proposed sensors (LLM generates, core validates)

> The generation half of "make auto-generation excellent": the agent — which understands the code —
> proposes the sensor; Hivelore refuses to trust it as a block until it proves it discriminates. This
> turns a captured lesson into a RELIABLE block instead of a heuristic guess.

#### Added
- **`propose_sensor` MCP tool** (enforcement profile) + **`hivelore sensors propose` CLI**: the agent
  writes the `pattern` (faulty usage) and an `absent` companion (correct-usage marker); Hivelore validates
  the proposal with `judgeProposedSensor` and only writes it when accepted. A `block` proposal is
  accepted ONLY if it is not brittle, stays SILENT on the current (correct) anchored code, and FIRES
  on the bad example. A rejected proposal is NOT written — the returned `reason`/`guidance` tells the
  agent how to revise and re-propose.
- **core `judgeProposedSensor`**: the pure accept/reject policy behind both façades.
- `mem_tried` now hints the agent to call `propose_sensor` to upgrade the auto-suggested warn sensor
  into a validated block.

#### Principle (completes the auto-generation overhaul)
- Generation is delegated to the LLM-in-the-loop (it understands the code); core's job is to VALIDATE
  and refuse to auto-trust what fails its own check. Recaps (post_task + anchor validation) and context
  (bootstrap_project + grounding, v0.28.5) already follow this; sensors now do too.

Verified end-to-end on a fresh non-Hivelore repo: a broad block proposal is REJECTED (fires on the current
correct code, with guidance to add `absent`); the discriminating proposal is ACCEPTED (silent on
current, fires on the bad example).

## [0.28.5] — self-validating sensors + grounded context (generate → verify → trust)

> Makes the auto-generation layer honest: an auto-artifact is trusted only after it passes a
> deterministic check. A sensor may hard-block only once it proves it discriminates; a generated
> context is flagged when it cites files that don't exist.

#### Added
- **Sensor self-validation** (`sensorSelfCheck`, `extractSensorExamples` in core): before a sensor can
  be promoted to `block`, it must be SILENT on the current (presumed-correct) anchored code and,
  when the lesson carries a bad example, FIRE on it. `hivelore sensors promote --severity block` now
  refuses (without `--force`) a sensor that matches the current code — the false-positive gate that
  trains agents to ignore enforcement. Reports fires-on-bad / silent-on-current.
- **`hivelore doctor` `sensor-fires-on-current`** (Protection): flags block sensors that match the
  current HEAD — they false-positive on every commit and can't be trusted as protection.
- **Context grounding** (`extractReferencedPaths` in core): `hivelore doctor` reports
  `project-context-ungrounded` when a FILLED project-context cites file paths that don't exist on
  disk (the hallucination/staleness failure mode of generated context).

#### Principle
- Generation stays delegated to the LLM-in-the-loop (MCP prompts); core's job is to VALIDATE and
  refuse to auto-trust anything that fails its own check. Verification is the moat, not generation.

Verified end-to-end on a fresh non-Hivelore repo: a broad `console.log` sensor anchored to a file that
currently logs is REFUSED block promotion; the discriminating Stripe-idempotency sensor (silent on the
correct code) is allowed.

## [0.28.4] — discriminating sensors (fire on the faulty call, not every call)

> Closes the gap between the pitch ("blocks the repeat") and reality: autogenerated sensors used to
> match every use of an API (e.g. all `stripe.paymentIntents.create`), so promoting one to block would
> false-positive on correct code. Now they discriminate the faulty usage from the correct one.

#### Added
- **`sensor.absent`** (schema): an optional "correct-usage" regex. When `pattern` (the risky call)
  matches but `absent` also appears in a forward-biased window around the match, the catch is
  SUPPRESSED — the diff already includes the required companion. Encodes "X without Y".
- **Discriminating sensor generation** (`sensor-suggest.ts`): detects a required companion from the
  lesson text — "create **without** an idempotencyKey", "**must pass** an idempotencyKey",
  "missing/forgot/no X" — and emits `pattern`=trigger + `absent`=companion instead of a bare
  API-wide pattern. Message becomes "X without Y — <fix>".
- `hivelore sensors list` shows the companion as `only when missing: <regex>`.

#### Changed
- The `absent` window is forward-biased (lookback 2, forward 6): the required option is part of the
  call's arguments, which follow it — so a *separate* correct call sitting just above a faulty one no
  longer masks the faulty one (a failure caught while dogfooding on a foreign repo).

Verified end-to-end on a fresh non-Hivelore repo: capturing the Stripe-idempotency gotcha auto-generates
`pattern=stripe\.paymentIntents\.create`, `absent=idempotencyKey`; promoted to block, the gate fires on
a `create` call without the key and stays silent on the correct multi-line call beside it.

## [0.28.3] — honesty pass: kill briefing bias, deflate metrics, truthful protection

> Three fixes from dogfooding: stop the corpus from biasing the agent, stop the metrics from
> overstating value, and stop the protection score from outrunning the config.

#### Changed
- **Briefing bias loop broken.** `get_briefing` and the CLI `briefing` no longer auto-surface
  strategy/positioning memories (new config `briefingExcludeTags`, default
  `positioning, competitive, strategy, harness-engineering, roadmap`). They remain fully searchable
  via `mem_search` / `memory search` — only automatic injection is filtered, so the corpus informs
  facts without shaping the agent's opinions on every task.
- **Prevention metric deflated to real blocks.** The anti-pattern gate now records a prevention event
  only for catches that would actually hard-block (a deterministic sensor fired, or a high-confidence
  semantic match ≥ 0.75) — never the re-surfacing of an anchored note that merely shares a word with a
  broad diff. This ends the inflated "N repeats blocked" headline that counted one note matching every
  package.json commit.
- **Eval headline is the independent score.** `hivelore eval` now leads with the authored-only
  (independent ground truth) score; the blended authored+synthesized number is shown as a secondary,
  clearly-labelled self-referential sanity floor — never the headline.
- **Honest protection score.** `hivelore doctor` now reports `sensors-no-hard-block` (Protection) when
  sensors exist but none hard-block — enforcement is advisory, and the score reflects it — with a fix
  to promote a trusted sensor or retire noise.

## [0.28.2] — ephemeral session handoff (NEXT.md) + opt-out of auto recap memories

> Stop the low-signal auto `session_recap` dump from accumulating in — and biasing — the `.ai/`
> corpus, while preserving cross-session continuity via a single overwritten handoff file.

#### Added
- **`NEXT.md` ephemeral session handoff** (`@hivelore/core` `handoff.ts`): on automatic session end,
  Hivelore can write/overwrite one root-level `NEXT.md` (focus + open threads + next steps), meant to be
  gitignored. `buildHandoffMarkdown` / `writeSessionHandoff` / `readSessionHandoff` / `handoffAgeMs`.
- **Config `sessionHandoff`** (default `false`): enable the NEXT.md handoff on auto session end.
- **Config `autoSessionRecap`** (default `true`): when `false`, automatic session end no longer
  persists a `session_recap` MEMORY into the corpus. A manual `hivelore session end --goal ...` is
  unaffected (explicit recaps are always honored).

#### Changed
- `get_briefing` now falls back to surfacing `NEXT.md` as `last_session` when no recap memory exists,
  so continuity survives `autoSessionRecap=false`.
- The `requireSessionRecap` gate is satisfied by a recent `NEXT.md` handoff, not only a recap memory.
- This repo dogfoods the new policy: `autoSessionRecap=false`, `sessionHandoff=true`.

## [0.28.1] — repo cleanup (remove internal research/benchmark artifacts)

#### Removed
- **`docs/`** internal strategy/research/planning/recap documents (battle plan, harness
  coherence map, roadmaps, implementation plans, agent briefs, handoffs) — not user-facing.
- **`benchmarks/`** and **`benchmark-results/`** fixtures + artifacts, the
  `scripts/agent-roi-benchmark.mjs` proxy, and the root `benchmark:roi` package script.
- **`PLAN.md`** historical design doc (superseded by README/CHANGELOG).
- Seven research/positioning recap memories under `.ai/memories/team/` (harness-engineering
  positioning, competitive battle plan, state assessment). Product gotchas/decisions kept.

#### Changed
- Dropped dangling references to the removed docs/scripts from `cli` help text and a code comment.
- No behavioral change to published commands beyond one removed `stats` ROI hint line.

## [0.28.0] — cold-start on real monorepos + auto-publish + corpus hygiene

> Grounded in dogfooding Hivelore cold-start on a real 1.4 GB Next/Nest-style marketplace monorepo.
> The headline finding: on a monorepo with **nested git repos**, `git ls-files` doesn't descend into
> them, so the code-map indexed **2 of 1400+ files — silently**. Fixed and verified (2 → 1232).

#### Fixed
- **code-map now indexes nested git repositories** (monorepos with embedded repos / submodules).
  Previously the parent's `git ls-files` skipped them, leaving the entire code-context layer
  (`code_map`, `code_search`, `symbol_locations`, harness-coverage) near-empty on real monorepos.
  Each nested repo's own `.gitignore` is still respected — no fallback to indexing untracked junk
  (preserves the tracked-files-by-default decision). Verified on a real repo: 2 → 1232 files.
- **Stack detection reads nested package.json** (sub-packages / nested repos), so frameworks that
  live in a sub-package are detected, not just the root manifest (real repo: `react` → `react,
  reactquery, tailwind, vite, typescript`).

#### Added
- **`hivelore doctor` flags a near-empty code-map**: warns when many source files are on disk but few
  are indexed (untracked source, or a structure the indexer can't reach) — previously silent.
  New pure helper `countSourceFilesOnDisk`.
- **`release.yml` GitHub Action**: publishes the four lockstep packages to npm on a version tag,
  gated by the `npm-publish` environment (manual approval) + `NPM_TOKEN`. Closes the gap where a
  tagged release sat unpublished. (Does not change "agents never publish" — it's the human's tag +
  approval + secret.) Verifies the tag matches the package version before publishing.

#### Changed
- **Brittle sensors can never hard-block.** A sensor with a brittle pattern (hardcoded line
  numbers/literals) is downgraded to `warn` at match time even if promoted to `block` — a fragile
  false-positive gate is what trains agents to ignore the gate. `hivelore doctor` now also reports the
  brittle-sensor count under Corpus health.

## [0.27.0] — harness-quality batch: trustworthy sensors, eval honesty, version-aware briefings

#### Added
- **Sensor brittleness lint** (`sensorPatternBrittleness`): high-precision detector for sensors over-fit
  to incident-specific literals (hardcoded line numbers / ranges like `1131-1186`). Digits inside
  character classes/quantifiers (`[0-9]`, `{2,}`) generalize and are never flagged. Wired into:
  `hivelore sensors list` (marks `⚠ brittle` + a count) so dead sensors are visible, not silently counted
  as protection; and `hivelore sensors promote` (refuses to promote a brittle sensor to `block` without
  `--force` — a brittle hard-gate is how false positives train agents to ignore the gate).
- **`server_version`** in the `get_briefing` MCP output, so an agent/human can spot a stale MCP server
  vs the repo in-band (previously only `hivelore doctor` surfaced it).
- **Structured breadcrumbs**: `breadcrumbs.start_here_items[]` — a typed twin of `start_here`
  (`{type,id,scope,file,line,kind,…}`) so agents act without parsing strings. Still pointers, never body copies.
- **`hivelore eval` authored-only score**: when a run blends authored (independent) and synthesized
  (self-referential) cases, the report and `--json` now surface the **authored-only** score separately
  so a flattering 100/100 isn't read as ground truth. Counts authored sensor cases too.

#### Changed
- Sensor autogeneration is more conservative: error/diagnostic words (`unknown`, `exception`,
  `fallback`, …) are stopworded and multi-word prose / error-output fragments (e.g. a backtick span
  `CACError: Unknown option …`) are rejected, killing the residual "dead sensor" class that never
  matched a real diff. (Line-number/file-ref rejection already existed.)

## [0.26.6] — faster repeated search + index staleness transparency

#### Changed
- `Embedder.create()` now caches the fully-initialized embedder per model. The ONNX pipeline was
  already cached, but every `create()` re-ran a "dimension probe" inference — so each `code_search`
  / semantic-search call paid for two inferences instead of one. Repeated searches in a session are
  now materially faster (calls 2..N skip the probe entirely). Behaviour is unchanged.
- `hivelore index code --status` now reports a **freshness verdict**, not just a timestamp: the code-map
  is flagged stale when a file it lists changed after generation, and the code-search index is flagged
  stale when it was built from an older code-map. Verdicts are included in `--json` (`code_map.stale`,
  `code_search_index.stale`) for CI/agents. Cheap — stat-only, no re-walk or re-embedding.

#### Added
- `code_search` MCP tool now returns `stale: true` plus an actionable notice when the embeddings index
  was built from an older code-map, so agents know results may miss newly added/moved symbols instead
  of silently trusting stale hits. New pure helper `isCodeIndexStale` (no false alarms on unknown
  timestamps).

## [0.26.5] — hybrid code_search ranking (exact symbol names first)

#### Changed
- `code_search` / `codeSemanticSearch` now re-ranks results with a small deterministic lexical bonus
  layered on top of the semantic cosine: an exact symbol-name match (+0.30), a partial name-token
  match (up to +0.20, proportional), and a filename-token match (+0.05). This lifts the symbol you
  literally named above merely-similar neighbours — e.g. querying `rebuildCodeIndex` now returns the
  function named `rebuildCodeIndex` first. No new index, model, or dependency; reuses data already in
  the code index entry.
- `min_score` keeps its documented meaning — a pure-semantic noise floor — so the lexical bonus
  re-orders the relevant set without letting incidental filename tokens leak weak hits past the gate.
  Ties break deterministically (score → semantic → file → line) for stable output.

## [0.26.4] — leaner breadcrumbs (map, not manual) + honest token budget

#### Changed
- `get_briefing` breadcrumbs `start_here` is now a terse pointer (priority · id · scope/type · anchor)
  instead of re-summarizing the memory body that already ships in `memories[]`. This removes the
  duplication introduced in 0.26.3 and keeps the default context genuinely small.
- `hivelore briefing` mirrors the same change: the `Start here` block is a pointer list, not a second
  copy of each memory body (the full body still prints below).

#### Fixed
- `get_briefing` now counts the breadcrumbs payload toward `estimated_tokens` and reports it as
  `budget.spent.breadcrumbs`. Previously breadcrumbs were emitted after the token total was computed,
  so the reported budget understated the real wire size.

## [0.26.3] — breadcrumbs-first briefings and cleaner native bridges

#### Added
- MCP `get_briefing` now returns a `breadcrumbs` map with concise `start_here` pointers and
  `drill_down` calls, so agents can keep default context small and pull deeper memories/code only
  when a task needs it.
- `hivelore briefing` prints a `Breadcrumbs` section before full memory bodies, including first-hop
  memory pointers plus optional `mem_get`, `mem_relevant_to`, `code_search`, and `code_map` follow-ups.

#### Changed
- Native bridges now frame Hivelore as a small breadcrumb map and recommend `get_briefing` with
  `budget_preset:"quick"` + `format:"actions"` before drilling deeper.
- Generated native bridges skip `personal` memories so committed agent files do not reference
  gitignored local-only records.

## [0.26.2] — native bridges become non-destructive managed blocks

#### Added
- Native bridge files now carry a full `haive:bridge-start/end` managed block, so Hivelore can refresh
  its generated instructions/memories without owning the whole native file.
- `hivelore bridges status` reports each target as managed, legacy-managed, unmanaged, missing, stale, or
  invalid; `bridges list` remains an alias.

#### Fixed
- `hivelore bridges sync` now skips files with broken or duplicated Hivelore markers instead of appending or
  overwriting ambiguously. Existing human content outside Hivelore markers is preserved.
- `hivelore sync` uses the same bridge writer for existing native bridge files, including `AGENTS.md` and
  `CLAUDE.md`, eliminating drift between the legacy `--inject-bridge` path and native bridge sync.

## [0.26.1] — catch SonarQube stylistic/naming rules in the ingest quality floor

#### Fixed
- SonarQube uses numeric rule keys (`typescript:S103`, `python:S00117`), so the name-based stylistic
  denylist missed them. Added a curated set of Sonar formatting/naming/trivial-maintainability keys
  (S100/S101/S103/S105/S113/S114–S122/S125/S1110/S1116/S1131/S1542), normalized so legacy (`S00117`)
  and modern (`S117`) ids both match. Real security/quality rules (S2068 hard-coded creds, S5852 ReDoS,
  S1234 cognitive complexity) are untouched. Live-verified: `hivelore ingest --from sonar` on 5 findings →
  3 stylistic filtered, 2 security rules kept.

## [0.26.0] — quality floor for ingested findings and git seeds; flaky-test hardening

#### Added
- **Source-appropriate quality gates for the two remaining cold-start sources.** Calibration showed the
  specificity floor is the wrong tool for them (a finding body is always concrete → passes; a git-seed
  body is mostly boilerplate → fails), so each source gets its own gate:
  - **ingest** drops auto-fixable **stylistic** rules (semi/quotes/indent/prefer-const/prettier…),
    matched on the rule's last segment so prefixed ids count. `hivelore ingest --include-stylistic`
    opts back in; the MCP `ingest_findings` tool gains `include_stylistic`. Reports "N low-value/
    stylistic filtered".
  - **seed-git** drops mechanical **noise** subjects (merge/bump/release/deps/wip/format/typo) — a
    reverted merge or dep-bump is not a repo lesson.

#### Fixed
- The embeddings index test is now best-effort — it asserts when the Transformers.js model produced an
  index and never flakes the build when the model is unavailable in CI.

## [0.25.0] — enforce a quality floor on cold-start seeds; framework seeds become sensors

#### Added
- **`meetsSeedQualityFloor` + `SEED_QUALITY_FLOOR` (0.2).** A seed earns its place only if it carries a
  sensor (enforceable) OR is concrete and non-generic — lower than the 0.3 memory-lint bar because seeds
  are background framework reference, not claimed team knowledge. `seed-quality.test.ts` audits the whole
  shipped pack library and fails the build if anyone adds a low-value seed.
- Upgraded the 6 sub-floor seeds with sensors — flask (SQL f-string injection), prisma (`$disconnect`
  in serverless), zustand (whole-store subscribe), nestjs (ORM in controller, scoped to `*.controller.ts`);
  enriched the mongoose `.lean()` note. A fresh Next/Nest/Prisma repo now ships 4 active sensors (was 2).

## [0.24.0] — architecture guard, safe autogen sensors, radar-leak fix, cold-start commands, dashboard value line

#### Added
- **Architecture guard test:** prevention recording MUST funnel through the single shared
  `recordPreventionHits`; the build fails if any source bypasses it (kills the recurring
  "bolted-on entry points" drift that caused two silent leaks).
- **Dashboard "Value" headline:** repeats blocked (30d) · high-impact memories · active policies, with
  an honest "cost is real; payoff is downstream" note.

#### Changed
- **Cold-start:** the minimal auto-generated project context now surfaces detected run commands
  (test/build/lint/typecheck/dev) from `package.json` — the #1 non-guessable session-1 fact.
- Hardened `suggestSensorFromMemory` to reject degenerate tokens (numeric/line ranges, `file.ts:123`
  refs) so it never emits a nonsensical regex sensor (autogen stays warn-only).
- Benchmark `token_proxy` → `report_tokens_est`, relabeled "report only, NOT total agent tokens" — we
  have real runtime telemetry now; an honesty fix.

#### Fixed
- Briefing radar no longer leaks the parent repo's git history when the git toplevel is an ancestor of
  the project root.

## [0.23.0] — agent-edit coverage; guided conflict supersede

#### Added
- **`hivelore coverage` crosses the corpus with both committed git churn AND agent-edited hot files** from
  the PostToolUse observation log (`.ai/.cache/observations.jsonl`), merged and tagged per gap with its
  heat source (`git` | `agent` | `both`). New `--source git|agent|both`.
- **Conflict resolution is now a guided supersede, not just a deprecate.** `applyConflictResolution`
  promotes the winner (revision_count++, verified, linked) and has it adopt the loser's topic when it had
  none — so future `mem_save` upserts consolidate into the winner instead of spawning a third
  contradiction. `hivelore memory resolve-conflict --yes` writes both files; `mem_conflict_candidates`
  attaches a `suggested_resolution` (keep/supersede + apply command) to every pair.

## [0.22.0] — close the prevention-recording leak in the installed gate

Perfecting the existing loop (capture → brief → block → measure) before adding anything new; grounded in
a code-verified harness-engineering audit that found the headline "measure" leg leaked.

#### Fixed
- **`recordPreventionHits` is now THE single prevention recorder.** The git-hook gate, `hivelore sensors
  check`, and the anti-pattern MCP tool funnel through it (debounced), so what the installed gate
  **blocks** is finally **counted**. The regex/command-sensor path used to block without recording; only
  anti-pattern catches were recorded before.

#### Added
- `runSensorGate` records prevention for regex AND command sensors in the git-hook gate; shell/test
  command sensors run in-gate behind `enforcement.runCommandSensors`.
- `mem_tried` returns `sensor_generated` + a hint when the ratchet stays open (no paths / no distinctive
  token), so a paths-less capture isn't silently advisory-only.
- `hivelore eval` reports case provenance (synthesized vs authored) and warns when the score is purely
  self-referential.

## [0.21.0] — pre-commit gate auto-briefs; `hivelore briefing --json`

#### Added
- **Auto-brief:** the pre-commit/pre-push decision-coverage gate no longer blocks waiting for a manual
  `hivelore briefing` — it surfaces the relevant anchored decisions itself and records them in the session
  marker at commit time, then passes with `decision-coverage-autosurfaced`. New `enforcement.autoBrief`
  (default true); set false for the strict legacy gate.
- **`hivelore briefing --json`** emits the ranked memories + quality + counts (parity with the MCP
  `get_briefing` tool for scripting/CI).

#### Changed
- Stack-pack seeds get a clean "`<Stack>: <Rule>`" H1 so the corpus normalizer stops synthesizing ugly
  "Convention `<slug>`" titles.

## [0.20.1] — idempotent stack-pack re-seed, smoother decision-coverage gate

#### Fixed
- Stack-pack re-seed no longer creates duplicates across days/versions: dedup by a stable
  date-insensitive signature (`type-slug`) OR `topic` (`stack-pack:<stack>:<slug>`).
- The decision-coverage gate no longer blocks a commit over a policy memory you author in the **same**
  commit — a policy memory counts as covered when its own `.md` file is staged. Strictly loosens; never
  adds a false block.

## [0.20.0] — run regex sensors in the pre-commit gate, tighten matcher precision

#### Fixed
- **Regex sensors were orphaned from the commit gate.** The installed hook ran only `enforce check`
  (fuzzy anti-pattern matcher), while `hivelore eval` reported `catch_rate 1.0` — real commits had zero
  sensor protection. `runPrecommitPolicy` now runs `runSensorGate` (all regex sensors, any memory type)
  on the staged diff: block sensor → fails the gate, warn sensor → visible non-blocking finding.
- **Tightened fuzzy precision:** a non-anchored memory whose sensor did NOT fire → info (non-violation
  evidence); uncorroborated semantic review floor 0.6 → 0.65. Cuts the "20 mostly-irrelevant matches for
  a 3-line diff" noise that trains agents to ignore the gate.
- `memory-lint` `LOW_VALUE_GUESSABLE` now requires positive generic-advice evidence so an
  arbitrary-but-prose team policy isn't mislabeled.

## [0.19.0] — `hivelore init` generates all 12 native bridges, carrying memories + sensors

#### Changed
- A fresh `init` now produces **every** supported bridge via the shared generator, **after** seeding, so
  each carries the repo's memories + block sensors (before, init reached ~4 agents with an empty static
  template). New `--bridge-targets <all|comma-list>` (default all); `--no-bridges` still skips. The
  first-session report shows "Reach: N agent bridge(s) generated".
- The `HAIVE_PREAMBLE` shared by every bridge is upgraded to the full instructional body (repo map +
  4-step "Working through Hivelore" + Safety). Generic stack-pack memories stay **out** of bridges
  (on-thesis — bridges stay repo-specific + enforced rules).

## [0.18.0] — 12 bridge targets, +10 stack packs, eslint/npm-audit ingest

Closes the two adoption levers from the battle plan (reach + cold-start) where Hivelore was "good, not
ahead" vs memories.sh — while keeping the enforcement edge (bridges carry block sensors, not just memory
injection).

#### Added
- **Reach: 7 → 12 bridge targets.** Added `claude` (CLAUDE.md, now unified into the bridges pipeline),
  `cursor` (`.cursor/rules/haive-memories.mdc`), `roo` (`.roo/rules/haive.md`), `gemini` (GEMINI.md),
  `aider` (CONVENTIONS.md), joining cline/windsurf/continue/cody/zed/agents/copilot. Anchor paths render
  inline ("applies to: …") on every target.
- **Cold-start: +10 stack packs** — tailwind, vite, sveltekit, astro, typescript, monorepo, laravel,
  rails, dotnet, docker — with sensors where high-signal. Detection wired into `init` (composer.json →
  Laravel, Gemfile → Rails, .csproj → .NET, Dockerfile → docker, turbo.json/nx.json → monorepo).
- **`hivelore ingest --from eslint|npm-audit`:** ESLint JSON (cwd-relativized paths + derived sensor) and
  `npm audit` JSON (anchored to package.json).
- **seed-git:** new `workaround` signal (workaround/hack/band-aid/FIXME/stop-gap).

## [0.17.1] — cold-start metric integrity + proof-line wiring

Integration pass after merging Lot A (cold-start), Lot B (visible value), and Lot C (reach).

#### Fixed
- **No more fabricated "prevented mistake" events on the first post-init commit.** The anti-pattern
  gate's self-match guard only excluded `.ai/`; the same commit also stages every file
  `hivelore init` / `hivelore bridges` generate (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, `.cursorrules`, `.clinerules`,
  `.windsurfrules`, …, `copilot-instructions.md`, the haive workflows, `.gitignore`, MCP configs).
  Those mirror the seeded corpus, so a single distinctive word self-matched the seeded gotchas and
  recorded false catches (inflating the dashboard prevention trend and gate-precision). Generalised
  to `isHaiveOwnedPath` and applied to the literal/semantic **and** sensor paths (the sensor path
  previously scanned the raw, unstripped diff). Real anti-patterns in real code are still caught.
- Removed dead no-op code in `core/bridges.ts` (`renderMemoriesBlock`).

#### Added
- **Briefing proof line**: `get_briefing` now appends `briefingProofLine()` to its hints, surfacing
  the measured outcome ("this harness prevented N repeated mistakes") in-context. Returns nothing on
  a cold corpus, so a fresh repo never makes a hollow claim. (Wires the Lot B × Lot C coordination
  point that shipped as a TODO.)

### Lot C: Reach & feedforward

#### Added
- **`core/bridges.ts`** — pure bridge generator (`generateBridges`, `prepareBridgeData`,
  `bridgeMemorySummary`). Formats native config files for 7 harnesses: Cline (`.clinerules`),
  Windsurf (`.windsurfrules`), Continue (`.continuerules`), Cody (`.sourcegraph/cody-rules.md`),
  Zed (`.rules`), Codex/AGENTS.md, GitHub Copilot. Each bridge includes validated memories AND
  block sensors — the enforcement differentiator vs memories.sh.
- **`cli/commands/bridges.ts`** — `hivelore bridges sync` command. Idempotent (marker-based),
  supports `--all`, `--only <targets>`, `--max-memories`, `--dry-run`.
  Also exposes `hivelore bridges list` to show target status.
- **`BRIDGE_TARGETS`, `BRIDGE_TARGET_PATH`, `BRIDGE_MARKERS`** exported from `@hivelore/core`
  for use by Lot A (`init.ts` can call `generateBridges()` at init time — C6 interface).
- **C5 hook point**: `get-briefing.ts` now has a documented insertion comment for
  `briefingProofLine()` from Lot B (when that function is ready, import and wire it there).
- Tests: `packages/core/test/bridges.test.ts` — unit + per-target snapshot tests.

## [0.17.0] — one shared briefing-priority classifier (kill the CLI/MCP drift)

The must_read / useful / background tier was implemented **twice** — in the MCP `get_briefing` tool and
in the `hivelore briefing` CLI command — each on its own data shape. They drifted: the stack-pack
down-rank and then the env-workaround down-rank each had to be added in two places, and one was missed.
This extracts the single source of truth.

### Changed
- **New `@hivelore/core` `priority` module** owns `classifyMemoryPriority(signals)` + `priorityRank`.
  Both call sites now map their evidence (MCP: semantic scores; CLI: lexical scores) into a normalized
  `PrioritySignals` and call the same classifier, so the CLI and MCP can never disagree again.
- **MCP behavior is byte-for-byte preserved** (the `get_briefing` priority tests pass unchanged). The
  CLI gains the consistency wins it was missing: `requires_human_approval`, direct **symbol** matches,
  and exact **skill** hits now rank `must_read` in `hivelore briefing` too, matching the MCP path.
- Unit-tested in `packages/core/test/priority.test.ts`; the down-rank still only applies to *soft*
  (semantic/tag) matches — an exact hit or a direct anchor on a stack-pack/env-workaround memory still
  ranks normally.

## [0.16.2] — release hygiene

- Version bump consolidating the 0.16.1 dogfooding fixes (env-workaround corpus re-tag, CLI/MCP
  ranking drift, and the anti-pattern self-match fix) into a single publishable lockstep version. No
  code change beyond the bump — the 0.16.1 work landed across two commits, so the protocol requires a
  fresh version for the second shippable commit.

## [0.16.1] — apply the env-workaround down-rank to the existing corpus

- **Re-tagged the existing dev-environment workaround memories** (`crosspackage-deps-with-xyz-ranges`,
  `installing-hiveaicore-via-npm-install`, `npm-install-g-...`) with `tooling-debt`/`dev-workflow` so
  the 0.16.0 background down-rank actually applies to them — they were high-read-count notes crowding
  the briefing.
- **Fixed a CLI/MCP ranking drift:** `hivelore briefing`'s own priority classifier mirrored the stack-pack
  down-rank but missed the new env-workaround one, so the two façades disagreed. The CLI now also caps
  env-workaround memories at `background` (verified live: the install/hot-swap notes now render
  `[background]`). Same dual-renderer drift class as the recap fix — a shared classifier is overdue.
- **Fixed an anti-pattern self-match false positive:** editing a memory's own backing file (e.g.
  re-tagging an `attempt` whose body documents `npm install -g`) re-emitted the bad pattern into the
  diff, and the gate matched the memory against *its own file* and hard-blocked. `anti-patterns-check`
  now strips `.ai/` hunks before literal/semantic matching — knowledge-base edits can't corroborate
  "you reintroduced a bad pattern in code". Surfaced by dogfooding this very release.

## [0.16.0] — friction polish from real usage (dogfooding feedback)

After driving Hivelore end-to-end to ship 0.15.0, six concrete friction/noise points surfaced from
*actual use*. This release fixes the things that wasted time or trained the user to ignore the
harness — finishing the existing, not adding scope.

### Changed
- **Decision-coverage now accumulates across briefings.** `writeBriefingMarker` unions `memory_ids`
  and `files` with the session's existing fresh marker instead of overwriting. Every `get_briefing`,
  every pre-edit injection, and every `hivelore briefing` now ADDS to the consulted set — so a broad
  commit no longer demands one giant briefing covering every relevant decision at once. This was the
  #1 friction (a documented recurring gotcha). Pass `accumulate: false` to reset for a new session.
- **Failure detection no longer cries wolf.** `hivelore observe` no longer flags a bare non-zero exit
  from commands that routinely exit non-zero without failing — `grep`/`rg` (no match), pipelines
  (the last stage / SIGPIPE sets the code), `find`, `test`, `diff`. Real build/test/runtime errors
  are still caught by reliable text signatures (`error TSxxxx`, `ENOENT`, …). Stops the
  "N failures detected" nudge from being noise an agent learns to ignore.
- **Dev-environment workarounds no longer crowd the briefing.** Memories tagged as local tooling
  debt (`dev-workflow`, `hotswap`, `dev-env`, `local-setup`, `tooling-debt`) are capped at
  `background` priority unless they directly anchor a file being edited — so repo-specific team
  policy keeps the top slots instead of being displaced by high-read-count tooling notes.
- **Auto-generated session recaps are compacted at the top of the briefing.** A recap that is just a
  tool-call/file dump ("Auto-captured session…", "Edited N files across M tool calls") is reduced to
  its Goal line + Discoveries; human/`post_task` recaps pass through in full. Applied in both
  `get_briefing` (MCP) and `hivelore briefing` (CLI).
- **Correct git-tag push advice.** `CLAUDE.md` and the release findings now recommend
  `git push origin vX.Y.Z` instead of `git push --tags` (which fails on pre-existing divergent tags).

### Notes
- New pure core helpers with unit tests: `recap` (`isAutoRecap`/`compactAutoRecapBody`),
  `isEnvWorkaroundMemory`, and `writeBriefingMarker` accumulation. CLI `detectFailure`/
  `isExpectedNonzeroExit` are now exported and tested.

## [0.15.0] — perfect the existing harness (harness-engineering gap closure P0–P3)

A grounded analysis of Hivelore against the harness-engineering literature (Fowler/Böckeler, LangChain,
Addy Osmani, awesome-harness-engineering) surfaced eight *real* gaps — verified in code, not on the
surface. This release closes all eight, finishing features the schema/UX already promised rather than
adding new scope.

### Added
- **P0-1 — executable shell/test sensors.** The schema reserved `kind: "shell" | "test"` but never ran
  them. `hivelore sensors check --commands` (or `enforcement.runCommandSensors: true`) now executes a
  memory's sensor command and treats a non-zero exit as a hit — turning lessons a regex can't express
  into real deterministic guardrails. Off by default (runs repo-authored commands).
- **P0-2 — failure-capture gate.** `hivelore enforce finish` now reads the session's `failure_hint`
  observations and flags hard failures that were never written down as a lesson. Advisory by default
  (`enforcement.failureCaptureGate: off | warn | block`) — the ratchet that stops silent re-introductions.
- **P1-3 — `hivelore coverage`.** Crosses the repo's hottest files (git churn) with the memory corpus to
  surface frequently-edited files with no covering memory — the harness blind spots. The inverse of
  `hivelore eval` (which checks the memories that exist surface correctly).
- **P1-4 — eval score trend + CI record.** `hivelore eval --record` appends each run's score to a history
  log; `hivelore eval --trend` renders a sparkline (latest/best/Δ). The generated CI gate now records and
  trends the score, so a harness-quality regression is a number, not a vibe.
- **P2-5 — `hivelore memory resolve-conflict`.** Turns a detected contradiction into a resolution:
  deterministically keeps the stronger memory (status → revision_count → recency) and deprecates the
  other. Detection existed; this applies the fix.
- **P2-6 — gate precision in the dashboard.** A new rollup shows whether the inferential anti-pattern
  gate's catches are real (useful) or noise (rejected), and suggests tightening/loosening
  `enforcement.antiPatternGate` accordingly.
- **P3-7 — `hivelore memory seed-git`.** Cold-starts the corpus by proposing draft `attempt` seeds from
  revert/hotfix commits in git history — zero manual authoring on a fresh/legacy repo.
- **P3-8 — `haive merge-driver`.** A deterministic git merge driver for memory files: collisions under
  `.ai/memories/` resolve by `revision_count → created_at` instead of leaving `<<<<<<<` markers.
  `haive merge-driver install` wires git config + `.gitattributes`.

### Notes
- All new computational layers are pure functions in `@hivelore/core` (`coverage`, `failure-coverage`,
  `eval-history`, `conflict-resolve`, `gate-precision`, `seed-git`, `merge-memory`) with unit tests;
  the CLI orchestrates I/O around them. Out of scope (deliberately): the behaviour harness (test
  generation/verification) — Hivelore complements tests, it does not replace them.

## [0.14.0] — make the harness helpful, not a burden (friction P0–P3)

The exit machinery and outcome metrics are solid; the *entry* friction was the thing that would make
an agent (or human) stop using Hivelore. This release attacks that directly — surface context, don't
block; and trim what wastes time.

### Changed
- **P0 — the pre-edit gate now ADVISES by default instead of blocking.** When you edit a file whose
  anchored team policy wasn't surfaced yet, the PreToolUse hook now *injects that memory's content
  into the agent's context* (via `additionalContext`) and **allows the edit** — no round-trip, no
  separate `hivelore briefing` command. It also records the policy into the briefing marker, so the
  commit-time decision-coverage gate accumulates coverage as you edit. Set
  `{ "enforcement": { "preEditGate": "block" } }` to keep the strict behaviour (which now also
  records context, so a simple re-issue of the edit passes — still no briefing command).
  The commit gate and CI enforcement remain the hard backstops.
- **P0 — decision-coverage ignores Hivelore-generated artifacts** (`.ai/project-context.md`,
  `.ai/code-map.json`, `.ai/.cache|.runtime|.usage/`). They are tool-generated, not human decisions,
  and were the cause of release commits being blocked over a repair-touched file.
- **P2 — `get_briefing` no longer re-emits an unchanged project context** within a short window
  (8 min). The first call sends it and records a content-hash marker; repeats omit it with a short
  notice (the agent already has it). Pass `dedupe_project_context: false` to force a full copy. Saves
  ~1.5k tokens per repeat briefing in a long session.

### Added
- **P3 — `hivelore dev link`** codifies the dist→global hot-swap (including the nested `@hivelore/core`
  copies pnpm requires), so working on Hivelore itself no longer needs a copy-paste shell snippet or an
  npm publish to test enforcement/MCP/hook changes against the real `haive` binary.
- New `enforcement.preEditGate: "advise" | "block"` config (default `advise`).

### Notes
- **P1 — diff-scan layers are now documented in-place.** `sensors check` (regex) and
  `anti_patterns_check` (memory match) are components; `pre_commit_check` combines them; `hivelore
  enforce check` is the gate. The overlapping commands now say so in their descriptions.

## [0.13.9] — prevention from the anti-pattern path + trend + recurrence

Completes the outcome-measurement story started in 0.13.8.

### Added
- **Anti-pattern catches now count as prevention events.** `anti_patterns_check` (and therefore the
  pre-commit gate) records a prevention event for its **strong, diff-corroborated** matches (a fired
  sensor, a distinctive literal overlap, or anchor+literal) — weak semantic-only matches stay
  advisory and are NOT counted. So the semantic feedback path contributes to the outcome metric, not
  just regex sensors.
- **Prevention event log + trend.** Each catch is appended to `.ai/.cache/prevention-log.jsonl`
  (gitignored telemetry, never committed). `hivelore dashboard` now shows a **trend** (catches in the
  last 7d / 30d and a weekly sparkline) computed from the log — so you can see whether the harness is
  catching more or fewer mistakes over time.
- **Recurrence metric.** The dashboard surfaces **lessons re-introduced after capture** — memories
  whose guardrail fired on **≥ 2 distinct days** (a genuinely recurring mistake, not a re-scan of the
  same diff). A high recurrence count flags a problem the team keeps reintroducing, where the root
  cause may need a stronger fix than a memory.

### Notes
- New pure `core/prevention.ts` (`appendPreventionEvent` / `loadPreventionEvents` /
  `computePreventionTrend` / `computeRecurrence`) — unit-tested; `buildDashboard` takes the events
  via options and stays pure.

## [0.13.8] — skip-ci prevention hook + outcome measurement

### Added
- **`commit-msg` hook that PREVENTS the skip-ci footgun.** `hivelore enforce install` now installs a
  `commit-msg` hook (and a `hivelore enforce commit-msg <file>` command) that blocks a commit whose
  message contains a CI-skip directive ([skip ci] / [ci skip] / [no ci]) **when the commit also
  changes shippable code** — GitHub scans the whole message and would skip CI for the entire push.
  `.ai/`-only sync commits (which legitimately use [skip ci]) are allowed, and `#` comment lines are
  ignored. This is the preventive counterpart to 0.13.7's post-hoc detection.
- **Outcome measurement — prevention events.** A new `prevented_count` / `last_prevented_at` usage
  signal records when a memory's sensor actually fires on a scanned diff (`hivelore sensors check`),
  i.e. the encoded lesson intercepted a known mistake before it landed. This is Hivelore's first true
  OUTCOME metric (defect prevented), distinct from retrieval (reads) and self-reported usefulness
  (applied). Recording is debounced (5 min) so re-scanning the same diff doesn't inflate counts.
- **`hivelore dashboard` now shows a Prevention section** (total catch events, memories with catches,
  top memories by catches), and `computeImpact` folds `prevented_count` in as a top-tier
  demonstrated-value signal (3 catches can reach "high" on their own, like applied outcomes).

## [0.13.7] — release/enforcement reliability hardening

Five fixes to the exit machinery — the brittle, footgun-prone part that lands every change.
Driven by friction hit firsthand while shipping 0.13.2–0.13.5.

### Fixed
- **A — `hivelore briefing` now records the anchored-policy memory ids in the briefing marker.**
  The decision-coverage gate suggests "Run `hivelore briefing --files …`" as its fix, but the CLI
  briefing wrote a marker with no `memory_ids`, so the suggested command never unblocked the gate
  (only the MCP `get_briefing` did). The CLI briefing now writes exactly the validated policy
  memories anchored to the requested files, using the same match function the gate uses — so the
  fix the tool proposes is the fix that unblocks. CLI/MCP briefing are now at parity here.
- **B — the atomic pre-commit staging is generalized** beyond `project-context.md` to every tracked
  `.ai/` file the lightweight repair re-synced (auto-promoted/re-validated memories, code-map),
  excluding machine-local telemetry (`.usage`/`.runtime`/`.cache`). Closes the general case of a
  later `chore: hivelore sync` tip skipping CI, not just the version-header case.
- **D — external CI integrations (SonarQube/CodeQL/Snyk/Codecov) are treated as advisory** in
  `enforce finish`: a transient failure (network/timeout) is surfaced as a non-blocking `info`
  instead of a blocking error, so an external service can't masquerade as a product regression
  (aligns with the "zero hard dependency on the user's environment" principle). Core workflow
  failures still block.
- **E — when no Actions runs exist for HEAD, the gate detects a skip-ci directive in the commit
  message** and says so explicitly (GitHub scans the whole message, subject and body), with a fix
  that points to rewording or `gh workflow run`. Turns a confusing "no runs" into an actionable cause.

### Changed
- **C — `enforce finish` now prints a single "NEXT REQUIRED ACTION"** when it blocks: the first
  blocking finding (in protocol order) with its fix, so the exit path is a guided next step instead
  of a checklist the agent must reassemble.

## [0.13.6] — strategic VS Code cockpit and English tool surface

### Added
- **VS Code Strategic Cockpit and Discipline Inbox** for observability, eval status, sensor hygiene,
  memory impact, and suggested context-discipline actions.

### Changed
- **Tool-authored copy is now consistently English** across CLI/MCP generated action-required memories,
  GitHub Action examples, VS Code docs/media, benchmark fixtures, Sonar examples, and project docs.
- **Team memory records were translated to English** while keeping IDs and anchors stable, so future
  briefings stay coherent without breaking references.

### Fixed
- GitHub Action action-required body stripping now recognizes both the new English heading and the
  legacy French heading for older auto-generated memories.

## [0.13.5] — surface coherence Phases C/D/E (disambiguation + grouping)

### Changed
- **Phase C — `bench` renamed to `selftest`** (with `bench` kept as an alias). The two near-identical
  names no longer collide: `selftest` checks the local install's latency; `benchmark` measures
  Hivelore-vs-plain agent value. Both descriptions now state the distinction explicitly.
- **Phase D — `install-hooks` and `precommit` are labelled as `enforce` equivalents** in their help
  (`install-hooks` = `enforce install`, `precommit` = `enforce check --stage pre-commit`), so the
  overlap is discoverable instead of confusing. Kept as-is (non-breaking); `enforce` remains canonical.
- **Phase E — the advanced surface is now grouped by family in `hivelore --advanced --help`**
  (reports / eval / index / runtime / ops). Shown only in advanced help so the default golden-path
  help stays focused.

### Notes
- Deeper command-tree regrouping (moving `dashboard`/`stats` under a `report` parent, or `code-search`/
  `embeddings` under `index`) is **intentionally deferred**: `report` is already a subcommand of
  `benchmark` and `index` is a leaf command, so those moves would require renaming existing commands —
  i.e. they'd be breaking, which violates the non-breaking rule of the coherence map. Documented in
  `docs/HARNESS-COHERENCE-MAP-2026-06.md`.

## [0.13.4] — atomic release commits (no more `[skip ci]` tips)

### Fixed
- **The pre-commit gate (`enforce check --stage pre-commit`) now stages the project-context version
  header it re-syncs.** Previously a version bump left `.ai/project-context.md` drifting (the repair
  ran *after* staging), so the `haive-sync` workflow committed a `chore: hivelore sync [skip ci]` tip on
  top of the release — which skips CI for the whole push. Now the re-synced header lands in the release
  commit itself, keeping the release commit the push tip (decision
  `2026-06-02-decision-atomic-release-commit-and-skip-ci-tip`). Best-effort and scoped to the
  project-context file, so telemetry churn (the tool-usage log) still flows through a later sync.

## [0.13.3] — golden path made visible (harness coherence, Phase B)

### Changed
- **`hivelore --help` now documents the golden path** — the day-to-day workflow
  (`init → doctor → agent setup → briefing → memory save/tried → sensors check → enforce finish → sync → session end`)
  and the CLI↔MCP verb parity (`memory save/search/get/delete ↔ mem_save/mem_search/mem_get/mem_delete`,
  old verbs still aliased). Makes the already-existing focused surface (core commands visible by default,
  the rest one `--advanced` away) explicit instead of implicit.
- **README**: new "CLI at a glance — the golden path" section with the ~11 core commands grouped by
  lifecycle stage and the verb-parity note. Phase B of `docs/HARNESS-COHERENCE-MAP-2026-06.md`.

## [0.13.2] — CLI verbs aligned with MCP tool names (harness coherence, Phase A)

### Changed
- **`hivelore memory` verbs now mirror the MCP tool names** so an agent learns one vocabulary across
  both façades: `add → save`, `query → search`, `show → get`, `rm → delete`. The old verbs remain
  as **aliases** (`save|add`, `search|query`, `get|show`, `delete|rm`) — no existing script or hook
  breaks. The core memory surface and user-facing hints (`doctor`, `welcome`, `sync`, `stats`,
  `memory pending`) now use the canonical verbs.
- Background: a CLI/MCP surface coherence audit found the real cohesion gap was **vocabulary drift
  between the two façades** (not duplicate commands, and not a flat surface — the golden path and
  MCP tool profiles already existed). See `docs/HARNESS-COHERENCE-MAP-2026-06.md`.

### Notes
- `memory digest` (a Markdown review report) is intentionally **not** aliased to MCP `mem_distill`
  (observation clustering) — they are different operations. That parity gap is tracked, not papered over.

## [0.13.1] — regression gate wired into generated CI

### Added
- **`hivelore init` now wires `hivelore eval --regression-gate` into the generated CI** (a `pr-eval-gate`
  job in `haive-sync.yml`, runs on pull requests). It fails a PR only when the harness quality score
  drops vs the committed `.ai/eval/baseline.json`, and is a **no-op when no baseline exists** — so it
  is safe to ship enabled by default and needs nothing external (no secrets, no services). Create a
  baseline with `hivelore eval --baseline` to turn the gate on.

## [0.13.0] — portable extensions (Sonar live-fetch, regression gate, more packs)

> Design principle reinforced this release: **every Hivelore tool works standalone**. No command
> requires an external service or a specific local setup; optional integrations degrade gracefully
> with one clear message and never crash. See decision
> `2026-06-02-decision-tools-must-be-environment-independent`.

### Added
- **`hivelore ingest --from sonar-api`** — fetch open issues live from any SonarQube/SonarCloud
  instance over plain HTTPS (Node built-in `fetch`), with `--sonar-url` / `--sonar-token` /
  `--sonar-component` (or `SONAR_HOST_URL` / `SONAR_TOKEN`). **No MCP or special setup required** —
  if creds are absent it prints one actionable message and exits; file-based `--from sonar|sarif`
  always works regardless.
- **`hivelore eval --regression-gate`** — CI-safe quality gate: compares against the baseline IF one
  exists (failing on a score regression) and otherwise no-ops (exit 0), so it can be dropped into any
  pipeline unconditionally.
- **Three new stack packs** — `flask`, `vue`, `spring` — with curated sensors (flask
  `app.run(debug=True)`, vue `v-html` XSS, spring wildcard `@CrossOrigin`).

## [0.12.9] — eval baseline & delta reporting

### Added
- **`hivelore eval --baseline`** snapshots the current report to `.ai/eval/baseline.json`, and
  **`hivelore eval --compare`** re-runs and prints the per-metric delta (overall score, mean recall,
  MRR, sensor catch-rate) with an IMPROVED / REGRESSED / UNCHANGED verdict — making the "Hivelore
  improves agent retrieval by N%" claim reproducible.
- **`--fail-on-regression`** turns a score drop vs the baseline into a non-zero exit for CI gates;
  **`--baseline-file <path>`** overrides the default location.
- New pure `compareEvalReports` / `EvalDelta` in `core/eval.ts` (CLI does the I/O).

## [0.12.8] — AGENTS.md portable bridge

### Added
- **`hivelore init` now emits `AGENTS.md`** (the emerging cross-harness convention used by Codex and
  others) alongside CLAUDE.md / .cursorrules / copilot-instructions.md, so the `.ai/` corpus is
  consumable by any AGENTS.md-aware agent — not just Claude.
- **`hivelore sync --inject-bridge` injects the memory breadcrumbs into both CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md**
  by default (when present). An explicit `--bridge-file` still targets a single file.

## [0.12.7] — stack packs with executable sensors + backend packs

### Added
- **Stack-pack memories can now carry a curated regex `sensor`** — seeded templates become
  feedforward+feedback guardrails (the lesson fires deterministically on the user's own diff, not
  just when the briefing surfaces it). Seed sensors are `warn` + `autogen:false` (vetted; never
  auto-block).
- Crisp sensors added to high-signal existing packs: Next.js `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` secret leak, React
  `key={index}`.
- **Three new backend stack packs**: `fastapi`, `django`, `go` (seed via `hivelore init --stack
  fastapi,django,go`). Carry sensors where a precise pattern exists — django `DEBUG = True` and
  hardcoded `SECRET_KEY`, fastapi `uvicorn reload=True` and bare `except:`.

## [0.12.6] — observability dashboard

### Added
- **`hivelore dashboard` (+ `--json`)** — a non-interactive, scriptable observability snapshot of the
  memory corpus that an agent or CI job can read in one shot (unlike `hivelore tui`, which needs a TTY).
  Surfaces: inventory (by scope/type/status, active vs retired), impact tiers + the top memories by
  demonstrated utility, sensors (totals by severity + which ones actually fired), health (stale /
  anchorless / pending / prune candidates), decay (>90d), and corpus token weight.
- New pure core module `dashboard.ts` (`buildDashboard`) aggregating the existing impact, usage,
  sensor, retirement and decay primitives. No I/O — unit-tested in `core/test/dashboard.test.ts`.

## [0.12.5] — findings ingestion (self-feeding sensors)

### Added
- **`hivelore ingest` + `ingest_findings` MCP tool** — turn scanner findings (SonarQube issues JSON
  or any SARIF report from ESLint/Semgrep/CodeQL) into proposed, anchored `gotcha`/`convention`
  memories, pre-filled with a conservative `warn` sensor. This closes the review↔memory loop and
  kills the cold-start problem: a real defect a scanner found becomes a permanent guardrail that
  steers the next agent away from it.
- New pure core module `findings.ts`: `parseSarif`, `parseSonar`, `parseFindings`,
  `normalizeFindingSeverity`, `findingToDraft`, `draftsFromFindings`, `filterNewDrafts`. No I/O.
- Cross-run dedup via a stable `topic: ingest:<tool>:<rule>:<path>`, so re-running a scan upserts
  instead of duplicating. `--dry-run`, `--min-severity`, `--limit`, `--scope`, `--type` supported.

### Safety
- Ingested drafts are `status: proposed` and their sensors are `severity: warn` + `autogen: true`.
  Ingestion never auto-validates and never auto-blocks — a human reviews (`hivelore memory pending`)
  and promotes (`hivelore sensors promote <id> --yes`).

### Docs
- `docs/HARNESS-ROADMAP-2026-06.md` — reconciles a harness-engineering research wishlist against the
  actual codebase (most points already shipped) and sets the execution order; findings ingestion (B)
  was the one genuine gap and is delivered here.

## [0.12.4] — pipeline-aware finish gate

### Added
- **`hivelore enforce finish` now verifies GitHub Actions before agents close a task.** When the
  pushed HEAD has a GitHub remote, the finish gate checks `gh run list --commit <sha>` and blocks
  on missing, pending, failed, cancelled, or otherwise non-successful workflow runs.
- Added agent-facing closeout guidance in the post-task prompt, generated Hivelore bridge rules, and
  the team close-session skill so future agents know that remote pipeline success is part of the
  exit protocol.

## [0.12.3] — CI decision coverage runner fix

### Fixed
- **`hivelore enforce ci` no longer fails on local-only briefing markers.** GitHub Actions does not
  have the agent's `.ai/.runtime/enforcement/briefings` marker after push, so CI now reconstructs
  decision coverage from the committed diff and reports `decision-coverage-ci-pass` instead of
  blocking with `decision-coverage-missing`. Local/pre-commit/pre-push gates still require the
  real briefing marker.

## [0.12.2] — quality gate and doctor excellence pass

### Added
- **Repo-native eval specs** — `hivelore eval` now auto-loads `.ai/eval/spec.json` when present and
  merges those labeled cases with synthesized anchored-memory retrieval cases. Hivelore's own CI now
  exercises eight executable sensor cases, so the 0–100 score covers retrieval and guardrail catch-rate.
- **Sharper setup diagnostics** — `hivelore doctor` now reports missing local `pnpm`, stale or missing
  workspace `dist` artifacts, and dist/source version mismatch as explicit actionable findings.
- **Architecture coverage memories** — core, CLI, and MCP package boundaries are documented as anchored
  team memories so harness coverage reflects real module policy instead of generic advice.

### Improved
- Low-value generic workflow memories were rewritten as concrete Hivelore release/toolchain policies,
  including the exact CI-equivalent command chain and the `npx pnpm@9.14.2` fallback.
- CLI docs, README, and PLAN now describe eval specs, doctor setup drift checks, and the current
  harness-engineering positioning.

## [0.12.1] — hybrid lexical rerank (much better semantic retrieval)

### Improved
- **`get_briefing` / `mem_relevant_to` ranking** now blends a BM25 lexical-relevance score
  (over the candidate set) into the sort. Previously a handful of popular high-read `attempt`
  memories dominated *every* task because their type+confidence bonuses dwarfed the semantic
  cosine (0–1); the actually on-topic memory got buried. The lexical term (weight ≤12, well
  below the priority tier) lifts the memory that shares the query's distinctive terms.
  Measured with `hivelore eval`: semantic-only retrieval **19 → 98**, anchored **95 → 100**
  (no regression — anchored/symbol matches stay must_read).

## [0.12.0] — fewer false positives, CLI parity, eval CI gate

### Fixed
- **Pre-commit false positives** — the anchored gate hard-blocked whenever a diff shared
  *any* ≥4-char token with an anchored gotcha's body, firing on ubiquitous domain words
  ("memory", "scope", "input", "version") and on version-bump diffs — making agents work for
  nothing. A `literal` overlap now only corroborates a **block** when at least one shared token
  is *distinctive* to that gotcha (rare in the corpus, TF-IDF style; `core/distinctive.ts`).
  Common-word overlaps still surface for review but never hard-block.

### Added
- **`hivelore memory feedback <id> --applied|--rejected`** — CLI mirror of the `mem_feedback`
  MCP tool, closing the impact loop from the terminal.
- **`hivelore memory add --activation-keyword/--activation-glob/--activation-always`** — author
  skill progressive-disclosure triggers from the CLI.
- **`hivelore eval --fail-under <score>`** — non-zero exit below the threshold; wired into CI
  (`ci.yml`) so a briefing-retrieval or sensor-catch-rate regression fails the build.

## [0.11.0] — impact-aware ranking, eval harness, skill activation

### Added
- **Impact-aware briefing ranking** — `get_briefing` (and `mem_relevant_to`) now factor a
  memory's demonstrated-utility score into ranking: a memory agents actually applied, or whose
  sensor caught a regression, edges out an equally-relevant one that never proved useful. The
  nudge is small by design and never overrides anchor/symbol relevance. `impact_score` /
  `impact_tier` are surfaced on each briefing memory for transparency.
- **`hivelore eval`** — a rigorous, model-free, CI-runnable quality eval. Measures briefing
  retrieval (recall + MRR) and sensor catch-rate against labeled cases (`--spec`), or
  auto-synthesizes cases from the repo's own anchored memories (zero setup). Emits a chiffré
  0–100 score so a ranking/sensor regression fails the build. `--semantic-only`, `-k`, `--json`,
  `--out`.
- **Selective skill activation (progressive disclosure)** — `skill` memories may declare an
  `activation` block (`keywords` / `globs` / `always`). A skill with activation triggers is
  surfaced only when the task or edited files match, and an activated skill earns a ranking
  boost; skills without the block keep the legacy always-eligible behavior. Authorable via
  `mem_save`.

## [0.10.10] — closed-loop memory impact

### Added
- **Memory impact scoring** — new pure `computeImpact` (in `@hivelore/core`) combines the utility
  signals Hivelore already recorded but never correlated: reads + applied outcomes + a sensor that
  actually fired (positive) versus rejections, stale status, and dormancy (negative) into a single
  0–1 score, a tier (`high|medium|low|dormant`), and a prune-candidate flag.
- **`mem_feedback` MCP tool** — agents record whether a surfaced memory was `applied` (it steered
  the work) or `rejected` (wrong/unhelpful). This closes the loop: a read only means a memory was
  shown; `applied` means it demonstrably helped. Backed by a new `applied_count` usage signal.
- **`hivelore memory impact` CLI** — ranks memories by demonstrated utility and surfaces prune
  candidates (`--prune`), with `--tier`, `--id`, and `--json` filters.

### Notes
- Surfacing impact as a ranking weight inside `get_briefing` is intentionally deferred to a later
  increment to avoid destabilizing the briefing pipeline. Legacy `usage.json` records are
  normalized for the new fields, so the change is backward compatible.

## [0.10.9] — finish gate and release discipline

### Added
- **Final agent-exit gate** — `hivelore enforce finish` verifies that completed work is committed, pushed, versioned in lockstep, tagged, and that release tags exist on the remote.
- **Release-protocol prompt wiring** — bridge templates, post-task guidance, and project docs now instruct agents to run the finish gate before final responses.

### Fixed
- CI enforcement now inspects the committed base/head diff instead of only staged files.
- Shippable package typechecks no longer depend on stale workspace `dist/` artifacts.
- Autopilot repairs, stack-pack diagnostics, and assignment-style memory sensors now handle the audited edge cases more precisely.

## [0.10.5] — sensor promotion and sharper patterns

### Added
- **Sensor promotion workflow** — `hivelore sensors promote <memory-id> --yes` flips a vetted memory
  sensor to `severity: block`; `--severity warn` can soften it again.

### Changed
- **Sharper autogenerated sensor patterns** — assignment-style gotchas such as `open-in-view=true`
  now generate regexes that include the offending value instead of matching only the broad key.

## [0.10.4] — memory sensors Phase 2

### Added
- **Memory sensors Phase 2** — sensors now parse unified diffs per file, use stricter path scoping,
  surface `severity: block` as deterministic pre-commit blockers, and can be operated with
  `hivelore sensors list/check/export`.
- **Assisted sensor generation** — anchored `gotcha`/`attempt` records saved through `mem_save`,
  `mem_tried`, `hivelore memory add`, or `hivelore memory tried` can receive conservative autogenerated
  `warn` regex sensors.

## [0.10.3] — memory sensors (feedback computational layer)

### Added
- **Executable sensors** — a memory (`gotcha`/`attempt`) can now carry an optional `sensor` block in
  its frontmatter (`packages/core/src/schema.ts` → `SensorSchema`). Phase 1 supports `kind: "regex"`:
  a deterministic check that fires on the **added** lines of a diff, turning a documented lesson into a
  permanent guardrail. This is the harness "feedback computational" layer — same result every run, no
  embedding warmup. `shell`/`test` kinds are reserved for a later phase.
- **`@hivelore/core` sensor engine** — new `packages/core/src/sensors.ts`: `runSensors`, `runRegexSensor`,
  `compileRegexSensor`, `sensorAppliesToPath`, `addedLinesFromDiff` (pure, no I/O).
- **`anti_patterns_check` sensor reason** — sensors are evaluated alongside anchor/literal/semantic
  matches and surface as a new `"sensor"` reason, carrying `sensor_message` and `sensor_severity`.
  Sensor hits rank above all other reasons (deterministic, highest signal). Retired memories
  (`isRetiredMemory`) are excluded as before.

## [0.10.2] — harness positioning

### Changed
- **Product positioning clarified** — public docs, npm metadata, and CLI help now describe Hivelore as
  "repo-native memory and context policy for coding-agent harnesses", with explicit boundaries around
  tests, linters, evals, observability, and security tooling.

## [0.10.1] — corpus lifecycle and release guardrails

### Added
- **Build artifact verification** — new `pnpm check:artifacts` guard verifies the lockstep package versions and the
  built CLI/MCP versions after `pnpm -r build`; CI now runs it before typecheck/tests so stale dist/version skew is caught
  explicitly.
- **Memory lifecycle retirement** — `expires_when`, `obsolete`/`superseded`/`archived` tags, and explicit audit/history-only
  fixed notes now remove records from active briefings and anti-pattern scans by default. `memory lint` flags active records
  whose lifecycle metadata says they should be retired.

### Changed
- **Anti-pattern semantic noise** — semantic-only anti-pattern hits now require a default score of `0.45`; anchor/literal
  matches still surface, but weak broad semantic matches no longer pollute review output.
- Removed the duplicate `code_search` registration from the maintenance MCP profile.

## [0.10.0] — positioned for the unguessable

A benchmark (10 cold agents, 5 projects, hidden-policy rubric) showed Hivelore's real value: **correctness
on arbitrary, team-specific knowledge a model cannot infer (5/5 vs 3/5)** — not speed or token savings
(on inferable tasks it was pure overhead). This release re-shapes the product around that truth.

### Added
- **Specificity ("surprise") scoring** (`specificityScore`, `isLikelyGuessable` in `@hivelore/core`) — a
  cheap heuristic estimating how *unguessable* a memory is (concrete literals/identifiers/values vs generic prose).
- **Adaptive briefing.** `get_briefing` now returns `briefing_value: "high" | "low"`. When nothing
  team-specific matches the files/task, the auto-generated/unfilled project context is trimmed to a
  one-line note so the call stays near-zero-cost (config: `adaptiveBriefing`, default on). A capable
  model needs nothing extra there. Curated context is never trimmed. The `hivelore briefing` CLI mirrors this.
- **`memory lint` LOW_VALUE_GUESSABLE** — flags memories that read like generic best practice the model
  already follows, nudging curation toward unguessable team knowledge.
- **Aggressive corpus decay**: `hivelore memory archive --unread` deprecates memories by unread-age alone
  (ignoring anchor state); window defaults to `enforcement.decayAfterDays` (180). A stale corpus is
  actively harmful — it makes agents follow outdated policy.
- **Capture filter**: `mem_observe` now SKIPS low-specificity (guessable) observations by default to keep
  the corpus high-signal; pass `force: true` to override.

### Changed
- **Diff-aware gate.** Anti-pattern literal matching now considers only ADDED diff lines, so the gate
  fires on "you introduced the bad pattern", not "you touched/removed a file that mentions it" — fewer
  false positives on refactors.
- **Tighter CLI surface.** Default `hivelore --help` shows the 10-command core harness loop; `tui`,
  `welcome`, and the manual `precommit` variant move behind `--advanced` (everything still works).
- **Repositioned.** README/tagline now lead with the proven value — *stop agents from reinventing,
  wrongly, your team's non-obvious decisions* — and the benchmark section reports the honest 5/5-vs-3/5
  results with the real per-policy-type token costs. All speed/token-savings claims removed.

## [0.9.31] — gate consistency

### Fixed
- **`hivelore precommit` now honors `enforcement.antiPatternGate`.** Previously the standalone command always used its own `--anchored-blocks` default and ignored project config, so a team that softened the gate to `review` (or `off`) in `.ai/haive.config.json` still got hard blocks when running `hivelore precommit` by hand — diverging from the installed git hook. The gate→params mapping is now centralized in `@hivelore/core` (`antiPatternGateParams`) and consumed by both `hivelore enforce check` (the hook) and `hivelore precommit`, so the two surfaces can no longer drift. Explicit flags still override: `--block-on <mode>` and `--no-anchored-blocks`.

## [0.9.30] — enforcement honesty & quality pass

### Added
- **Honest, configurable anti-pattern gate.** New `enforcement.antiPatternGate` config (`off` · `review` · `anchored` (default) · `strict`). In `anchored` mode the pre-commit gate now **hard-blocks** a high-confidence `attempt`/`gotcha` that is anchored to a file you touch and corroborated by the diff — closing the gap where the documented "known bad approaches are blocked" only surfaced as a soft review. `pre_commit_check` gained an `anchored_blocks` parameter (and `hivelore precommit` a `--no-anchored-blocks` opt-out). Config/docs-only commits are still never hard-blocked.
- **Deterministic literal matching.** `anti-patterns-check` now tokenizes diffs on non-word boundaries (code-aware, with a keyword stoplist), so identifiers glued to punctuation (`Number(BigInt(a))`) reliably produce a `literal` signal instead of leaving blocking to depend on a warmup-sensitive semantic score.
- **`hivelore index code --status [--json]`** — report code-map / code-search index freshness without rebuilding.
- **`hivelore memory verify --json`** — machine-readable anchor-freshness output for CI/agents (exit 1 on stale).
- **`--files` alias for `--paths`** on `memory add` / `memory tried` / `memory update`, matching the MCP `files` parameter.

### Changed
- **Stack detection** no longer mislabels a TypeScript project as JavaScript when there is no root `tsconfig.json` — it scans for `.ts`/`.tsx` sources.
- **CI hardening:** type-check now runs *before* tests and is **blocking** (removed `continue-on-error`), catching the source/dist desync that previously surfaced only as confusing test failures.
- **Clearer `hivelore init` messaging:** user-level MCP client configs are reported as "user-level config — left unchanged" so it no longer looks like the project setup was skipped.
- **README aligned with reality:** enforcement section describes precise anchored blocking vs. surfaced review; the benchmark section now presents the honest internal pilot (`n=3`, proxy tokens, no raw-speed claim) instead of inflated headline deltas.

## [0.9.29] — developer curation

### Added
- **`hivelore memory seed [stack]`** — seed a stack pack of starter memories on demand (after `hivelore init`). Auto-detects stacks from `package.json` when no argument is given, supports `--list` / `--list --json` for discovery, and refreshes the embeddings index in autopilot. Seeded memories carry the `stack-pack` tag and stay at background priority until anchored.
- Enforcement hooks now give file-specific must-read reminders during `pre-tool-use` when a write targets files covered by validated anchored policies that were not in the current briefing.

### Changed
- `hivelore briefing`, `hivelore enforce session-start`, and wrapped `hivelore run` sessions now attempt lightweight autopilot repairs before generating context, so stale/missing semantic indexes are fixed before agents need them.
- `hivelore session end --auto` can synthesize a useful recap from the current git diff when no hook observation log is available.
- Enforcement findings now carry clearer educational details (`why`, files, and memory IDs) for missing decision coverage.

## [vscode-0.6.1] — brand icon

### Added
- **Brand icon & glyph** — honeycomb cluster with a single glowing amber cell (the "surfaced memory" signature). `media/icon.png` (256×256) is the Marketplace icon; the activity-bar container now uses the monochrome `media/logo-mono.svg` glyph (themable via `currentColor`) instead of the `$(book)` codicon. Adds `favicon.*`, `logo.svg`, `wordmark.svg`, and a README header logo. The preview page `media/index.html` is excluded from the packaged `.vsix`.

## [vscode-0.6.0] — developer curation actions

### Added
- **Seed starter memories from the editor** — `Hivelore: Add Starter Memories (Stack Pack)…` (sidebar title + command palette) lists supported stacks (auto-detected ones first) and seeds the chosen pack via `hivelore memory seed`.
- **Anchor a memory/seed to a file** — `Hivelore: Anchor Memory to File…` (context menu on any memory; inline action on seeds) anchors the record to the active file or one you pick, turning a generic background seed into high-signal, repo-specific context.
- **Promote a memory to the team** — `Hivelore: Promote Memory to Team` runs `hivelore memory promote` from the tree.
- **"🌱 Seeds — needs curation" group** — unanchored `stack-pack` seeds are surfaced as a dedicated curation queue with a 🌱 badge and a tooltip explaining how to raise them above background priority. Seed items expose an inline anchor action.
- Mutating curation actions run via the configured `haive.cliPath`, stream output to the Hivelore channel, and auto-refresh the tree/status bar.

## [0.9.28] — signal & coordination polish

### Changed
- **Stack-pack seeds no longer crowd out repo knowledge.** Memories pre-seeded at `hivelore init` are tagged `stack-pack` and capped at `background` priority in both the MCP `get_briefing` and the CLI `hivelore briefing` rankings, so a generic framework note never outranks a repo-specific memory unless it has been anchored to a file you are actually editing. Each seed now carries an honest footer, and the init message no longer calls them "validated team memories useful from J+0".
- **Bridge files are now a table of contents, not a manual.** `CLAUDE.md` / `.cursorrules` / `copilot-instructions.md` use a shorter, less imperative template (~25 lines), and `hivelore sync --inject-bridge` injects one summary line per memory (not full bodies) and skips `stack-pack` seeds — keeping the always-loaded bridge compact.
- **`pre_commit_check` weights warnings by file type.** A package/build/tooling gotcha (by tag or anchor) is downgraded to `info` when the change touches no package/build file, mirroring the existing config/docs-only downgrade. Cuts false positives on pure source edits.

### Added
- **MCP `get_briefing` (and `mem_relevant_to`) now write the enforcement briefing marker.** An MCP-native agent that calls `get_briefing` before editing satisfies the pre-tool-use / pre-commit gate directly, without shelling out to the CLI `hivelore briefing`. The marker records the surfaced anchored policy IDs so the per-file decision-coverage check passes for the files the briefing covered.

### Fixed
- Root `package.json` and `.ai/project-context.md` version aligned with the package builds (was `0.9.26` vs `0.9.27`), clearing the `repo-root-version-mismatch` doctor finding.
- Removed the obsolete `2026-04-28-decision-v028-features-overview` draft memory (shipped long ago, fully covered by this changelog) that had been flagged as a 30+ day stale draft and was polluting briefings for core files.

## [0.9.24] — autopilot indexing polish

### Fixed
- `hivelore index code` now includes untracked source files that are not ignored by git, so fresh or in-progress repos get useful code-map and code-search indexes before the first commit.
- `hivelore precommit --json` now emits valid JSON even when no files are staged.
- `hivelore memory add` in autopilot mode now refreshes the memory embeddings index immediately after creating or updating a record.
- `hivelore doctor --fix` now forces a code-map refresh when repairing autopilot indexes, while avoiding rewrites when the indexed file set is unchanged.

## [0.9.23] — cleanup and precommit signal polish

### Fixed
- `hivelore enforce cleanup` now preserves `.ai/.cache/.gitignore` while removing cache contents, so existing repos keep generated cache files ignored after cleanup.
- `pre_commit_check` now requires a very strong semantic score before blocking anti-pattern matches, reducing false positives from generic historical test notes while keeping plausible matches in review.

## [0.9.22] — autopilot convergence polish

### Fixed
- `hivelore doctor --fix` now refreshes memory embeddings as part of corpus repair, so semantic briefing diagnostics can converge without a separate manual `hivelore embeddings index`.
- Project-context version repair now works for generic bootstrapped contexts, not only the Hivelore repo's own `# Project context — Hivelore (v...)` heading.
- `hivelore init --bootstrap` writes current project version metadata and prepares `.ai/.cache` / `.ai/.runtime` ignore files from day zero.
- `hivelore enforce cleanup` preserves briefing markers while removing disposable runtime/cache files, so cleanup no longer makes local enforcement fail immediately afterward.
- `hivelore memory add` can derive a slug automatically and wraps plain bodies in a lint-friendly heading/guidance structure.
- `hivelore memory lint` no longer flags brand-new validated memories as `NEVER_READ` before agents have had time to surface them.
- `hivelore briefing --format compact` is accepted as a compatibility alias for users coming from the MCP `get_briefing` API.
- Root/workspace version skew and stale global Hivelore packages are now visible in `hivelore doctor` for the Hivelore workspace.

### Changed
- Harness coverage wording is stricter: sub-50% coverage is now described as partial instead of "good".
- pnpm overrides moved from the deprecated root `package.json` field into `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

## [0.9.21] — quality audit fixes

### Fixed
- `hivelore memory pending` now shows both `draft` and `proposed` memories (was silently ignoring drafts). Output is grouped and labeled: "Proposed — awaiting team validation" / "Draft — created but not yet activated".
- `hivelore memory list` now displays the memory title (first `#` heading from body) between the ID and file path lines — consistent with `hivelore welcome`.
- `hivelore memory tried` help text had a duplicate `(default: personal)` from Commander double-printing — fixed.
- VS Code Harness Health view: `DoctorScores` interface field names now match the actual `hivelore doctor --json` output (`protection_score`, `context_quality_score`, `corpus_quality_score`). Previously all scores showed as `undefined`/NaN.
- VS Code Harness Health view: `DoctorFinding.severity` now matches JSON (was incorrectly `level`), fixing finding icons.
- Root `package.json` version bumped to `0.9.20` (was stale at `0.9.19`).
- `.ai/project-context.md` version header updated to `v0.9.20`.

### Added
- `hivelore memory update` now accepts `--type <type>` to change a memory's type without losing its usage history (previously required `rm` + `add`).
- `hivelore memory update` now accepts `--body-file <path>` to load body from a Markdown file — consistent with `hivelore memory add`.
- `hivelore tui` is now visible in the default CLI help (was hidden behind `--advanced`). It is the primary interactive memory browser for humans.
- `hivelore session` command description now explains that session start is automatic (via hooks/MCP), so users are not confused by the absence of `hivelore session start`.

## [vscode-0.5.0] — harness engineering extension redesign

### Added
- **Harness Health view** — second panel in the Hivelore sidebar that runs `hivelore doctor --json` and displays protection, context quality, corpus quality, and harness coverage scores with color-coded pass/warn/error indicators. Findings grouped by section, expandable in the tree.
- **`skill` memory type** — `⚡ Skills` group appears first (after action-required alerts) in the sidebar tree, before all other types. Skill memories always expanded. CodeLens summary shows skills first with `⚡` icon.
- **Search memories command** (`Ctrl+Shift+H` / `Cmd+Shift+H`) — QuickPick fuzzy search across all memory titles, scopes, types, and tags. Opens the selected memory file beside the current editor.
- **Briefing command** (`Ctrl+Shift+B` / `Cmd+Shift+B`) — runs `hivelore briefing` for the active file and displays results in an "Hivelore Briefing" Output Channel with Markdown syntax highlighting.
- **`haive.runDoctor` command** — runs a full health check from VS Code, populates the Harness Health view, and reveals it.
- **`haive.syncMemories` command** — runs `hivelore sync`, reloads the tree, shows progress in status bar.
- **`haive.memTried` command** — two-step input (what + why) that runs `hivelore memory tried` in a terminal. Available in the editor right-click menu.
- **Approve / Reject memory commands** — context menu on tree memory items; also accessible by ID.
- **Show All Memories command** — clears the file filter and shows the full tree.
- **Pending Review group** — draft and proposed memories grouped under "🕐 Pending Review" (collapsed by default) so nothing gets lost in the queue.
- **Briefing panel** available from editor title bar and editor right-click menu (`haive.runBriefing`).
- **`haive.cliPath` setting** — absolute path to the haive binary for environments where haive is not on PATH.
- **`haive.briefingBudget` setting** — `default | deep | minimal` controls the token budget passed to `hivelore briefing`.

### Changed
- Status bar now shows pending count alongside action-required count.
- Memory tooltips now include read count, module, and domain fields.
- CodeLens per-memory list sorted by type priority (skills first, gotchas second).
- Stale memories shown with a dimmed icon in the tree.
- Unknown memory types no longer pollute the main list — collected into an "Other" group.

## [0.9.20] — harness engineering positioning + skill type + harness coverage

### Added
- New memory type `skill` — reusable procedure/playbook for recurring tasks (e.g. deploy checklist, code-review protocol). Equivalent to OpenAI's SKILL.md pattern. Skills are always surfaced as at least `useful` in briefings, `must_read` when they match semantically. No anchor required.
- `hivelore doctor` now reports a `harness_coverage_score` — the percentage of code-map files that have at least one validated memory anchor. Visible in both `--json` output and the human-readable "Harness coverage" section.
- `hivelore welcome` now lists `skill` memories first (before decisions, architecture, conventions) as they are the primary feedforward guides for new team members.

### Changed
- CLI description updated to "the memory and enforcement layer of your agent harness" to align with the harness engineering vocabulary (see [OpenAI harness engineering](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/)).
- All package descriptions and keywords updated with "harness-engineering".
- `skill`, `glossary`, and `session_recap` types are now excluded from the anchorless-majority warning in `hivelore doctor` and the per-memory anchor warning in `hivelore memory add` — these types are procedural/reference records that don't track code drift.

## [0.9.19] — bundled semantic autopilot

### Added
- `@hivelore/cli` and `@hivelore/mcp` now install `@hivelore/embeddings` as a real dependency, so a normal global Hivelore install includes semantic memory ranking and code-search support.
- `hivelore doctor` now checks embeddings availability, memory semantic index health, and code-search index health instead of reporting a healthy context score while semantic features are unavailable.
- The default MCP enforcement profile now exposes `code_search`, matching the code-search index that autopilot maintains.

### Changed
- `hivelore memory suggest --auto-save` now follows project defaults: autopilot projects save validated team records, while manual projects keep draft review flow.
- Generated memory-suggest templates now reference the real memory id in follow-up commands instead of a truncated query string.

## [0.9.18] — self-maintaining autopilot

### Added
- Added `autoRepair` config so autopilot can safely maintain project context metadata, corpus lint fixes, code-map refreshes, and code-search indexes without manual intervention.
- Added shared autopilot repair utilities used by `hivelore doctor --fix` and `hivelore sync`.
- `hivelore init` now writes autopilot projects with validated team memories, self-repair enabled, code-map creation, MCP setup, hooks, and CI from day zero.

### Changed
- `hivelore memory add` now follows project config defaults: autopilot projects create validated team records unless a scope is explicitly provided.
- `hivelore sync` now applies safe corpus/context repairs in autopilot mode and rebuilds both memory and code embedding indexes when code-search auto-repair is enabled.
- `hivelore doctor` reports project-context version drift without mutating files unless `--fix` is used.

### Fixed
- Autopilot init no longer suggests bootstrapping project context when the default autopilot bootstrap already ran.
- Memory lint anchor suggestions now ignore generated, ignored, and untracked paths to avoid polluting context records with noisy anchors.

## [0.9.17] — core signal quality and surgical enforcement

### Added
- `get_briefing` and `mem_relevant_to` now classify returned memories as `must_read`, `useful`, or `background`, and include a `briefing_quality` summary (`strong`, `thin`, or `noisy`).
- `hivelore memory lint --fix --dry-run|--apply` now reports simple corpus repairs and can add missing headings plus `needs_anchor` tags for validated anchorless policy records.
- `hivelore enforce check/status/ci --explain` now groups findings into blocking, review, and info sections.
- `hivelore doctor --json` now exposes protection, context quality, and corpus quality scores with sectioned findings and next actions.

### Changed
- Briefing ranking now prioritizes direct path/symbol anchors and directly relevant failed attempts ahead of popular but less relevant memories.
- `hivelore briefing` defaults to a tighter memory cap and prints memory priorities plus a briefing quality line.
- Precommit enforcement downgrades weak docs/changelog, config-only, and `.ai/.usage` telemetry matches to reduce false positives.

### Fixed
- `mem_save` topic upsert no longer writes `body` into frontmatter.
- `mem_save` now emits a strong warning when validated `decision`, `gotcha`, or `architecture` memories are saved without anchors.

## [0.9.16] — focused core surface and MCP profiles

### Added
- Added explicit MCP tool profiles: `enforcement` for the compact agent harness, `maintenance` for corpus/team stewardship, and `experimental` for broad research diagnostics; `full` remains a legacy alias for `experimental`.
- Added exported MCP profile constants and `getAllowedToolsForProfile()` so tests and integrators share the same source of truth.

### Changed
- The default CLI help now shows the core Hivelore workflow first: init, doctor, agent setup, briefing, enforcement, sync, session recaps, and high-signal memory commands.
- Maintenance and experimental CLI commands remain callable but are hidden from default help; use `hivelore --advanced --help`, `hivelore --advanced memory --help`, or `HAIVE_SHOW_ADVANCED=1` to show the broader surface.
- The `maintenance` MCP profile exposes lifecycle, review, lint/distill, import-adjacent, and code-search tools without enabling runtime journal, pattern detection, or exploratory why/conflict diagnostics.

## [0.9.15] — harness diagnostics and quieter enforcement

### Added
- Added install/version diagnostics to `hivelore doctor` and `hivelore enforce status` for stale absolute Hivelore binaries in hooks and MCP configs.
- Added `why` explanations to `get_briefing` memory results so agents can see why each context record was surfaced.
- Added glob-style anchor matching (`*`, `**`, `?`) and directory-symbol verification for broader module/pattern policies.

### Changed
- `pre_commit_check` now classifies anti-pattern matches as `blocking`, `review`, or `info`, with rationale text; the CLI hides weak FYI matches by default.
- The default MCP enforcement profile now includes `mem_tried`, `mem_get`, and `code_map` as focused core workflow tools.
- `hivelore memory lint` now flags low-actionability records, never-read validated records, and near-duplicate records.

## [0.9.14] — repo-native context enforcement positioning

### Changed
- Repositioned npm- and GitHub-facing docs around repo-native context enforcement instead of persistent memory.
- Updated README terminology to describe Hivelore records as enforceable context breadcrumbs for AI agents.
- Refreshed package metadata and VS Code extension wording around policy, breadcrumbs, and context enforcement.

## [0.9.13] — enforcement false-positive fixes

### Fixed
- Session recap updates now refresh `verified_at`, so strict gates count an updated recap as recent without rewriting its original creation date.
- `hivelore enforce` now checks recap freshness using `verified_at ?? created_at`.
- `pre_commit_check` no longer blocks `high-confidence` mode on literal-only or anchor-only anti-pattern matches; blocking now requires a strong semantic signal.

### Changed
- `hivelore precommit` now reports blocking anti-pattern warnings separately from advisory anti-pattern matches.

## [0.9.12] — agent-aware init and setup

### Added
- Added `hivelore agent detect/status/setup` to choose between native MCP, wrapped, and CLI fallback modes per machine.
- `hivelore init` now runs agent-aware setup, writes project MCP configs, records `.ai/.runtime/enforcement/agent-mode.json`, and asks before changing user-level AI client configs.
- Added Codex CLI MCP setup support via `codex mcp add haive ...` when Codex is detected and the user approves global setup.

## [0.9.11] — enforcement scoring and agent benchmark reports

### Added
- Added enforcement scoring to `hivelore enforce check/status/ci`, including configurable score thresholds.
- Added decision coverage checks: changed files now require relevant anchored decisions/gotchas/conventions to be surfaced in the latest briefing.
- Added `hivelore enforce cleanup` for generated `.ai/.cache` and `.ai/.runtime` artifacts.
- Added `hivelore benchmark demo` and `hivelore benchmark report` to make Hivelore-vs-plain agent trials a repeatable product demo.

### Changed
- Tightened the default MCP enforcement profile to the core workflow tools: briefing, memory save/search/verify/relevance, pre-commit check, and session recap.
- Briefing markers now record surfaced memory IDs and target files, allowing enforcement to verify that the right decisions were consulted.

## [0.9.10] — npm positioning and enforcement narrative

### Changed
- Reframed npm-facing documentation and package metadata around Hivelore as an AI-agent policy enforcement layer, with persistent memory described as the mechanism rather than the headline.

## [0.9.9] — agent-agnostic enforcement and `hivelore run`

### Added
- Added agent-agnostic enforcement commands: `hivelore enforce install`, `hivelore enforce status`, `hivelore enforce check`, and `hivelore enforce ci`.
- Added `hivelore run -- <agent command>` to wrap any CLI-based coding agent in a Hivelore-enforced session with `HAIVE_PROJECT_ROOT`, `HAIVE_SESSION_ID`, and strict enforcement env vars.
- Added a blocking GitHub Actions enforcement workflow template generated by `hivelore enforce install`.
- Added strict enforcement config fields for briefing, session recap, memory verification, stale-decision blocking, and mode selection.

### Changed
- `hivelore briefing` now writes a local briefing marker, so CLI-first agents can satisfy the same enforcement gate as hook-based agents.
- Autopilot `hivelore init` now installs agent-agnostic enforcement gates instead of only Claude Code hooks.
- Git hooks installed by Hivelore are now blocking workflow gates by default, not advisory reminders.

## [0.9.8] — enforcement hooks and default MCP profile

### Added
- Added Hivelore enforcement mode as the default MCP profile for initialized projects: the default MCP surface is now the smaller enforcement set, with `HAIVE_TOOL_PROFILE=full` available for the legacy full tool list.
- Added `hivelore enforce session-start` and `hivelore enforce pre-tool-use` for agent hooks. Claude Code hooks can now inject a briefing marker at session start and block write-like tools until briefing is loaded.
- Added `.ai/.runtime/enforcement/briefings/` marker support for local pre-edit enforcement.

### Changed
- `hivelore install-hooks claude` now installs `SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, and `SessionEnd` hooks instead of passive capture only.
- Autopilot `hivelore init` installs project-scoped Claude Code enforcement hooks when possible.

## [0.9.7] — enforcement direction and release hygiene

### Fixed
- Aligned the root package version and project context version with the publishable package line.
- Added consistent `shared` scope path support for memory file resolution.
- Restored full `pnpm -r typecheck` health across core, CLI, MCP, embeddings, VS Code, and GitHub Action packages.
- Updated CLI/MCP call sites for current `code_map` and embeddings APIs.

### Added
- Added an enforcement strategy plan for narrowing Hivelore around briefing gates, PR guardrails, and a smaller default MCP tool surface.

## [0.2.0] — token-aware briefing, code map, sync hooks

### Added — token reduction
- **`get_briefing` MCP tool**: one-shot onboarding that bundles project
  context + module contexts + ranked relevant memories under a token budget.
  Replaces 4–5 separate calls (`get_project_context`, `mem_for_files`,
  `mem_search` literal, `mem_search` semantic) and dedupes results
  ranked by reason (anchor / module / semantic / domain) and confidence.
- **Code map** (`hivelore index code` → `.ai/code-map.json`): static parse of
  TS/JS exports per file with JSDoc-derived 1-line descriptions. AIs read
  the map (~30KB on this repo) instead of greping 30+ files. Exposed as
  the `code_map` MCP tool with file/symbol filters.
- **Token budget helpers** in `@hivelore/core`: `estimateTokens`,
  `truncateToTokens` (head/tail/middle), `allocateBudget` distributes a
  global budget across weighted parts and re-allocates surplus from
  small parts to larger ones.

### Added — sync on merge / near-realtime
- **`hivelore sync`**: refreshes anchor verification + auto-promotion in
  one command. `--since <ref>` reports memories added/modified/removed
  vs a git ref. `--quiet` for hooks.
- **`hivelore install-hooks`**: writes `.git/hooks/post-merge` and
  `post-rewrite` that run `hivelore sync --quiet --since ORIG_HEAD` so
  every pull/merge updates memory state automatically.
- **GitHub Action template** at `.github/workflows/haive-sync.yml.example`:
  on push to main/develop, runs sync and commits any state updates;
  on PR, comments if memories anchored in the diff would become stale.

### Added — quality of life
- **`hivelore memory hot [--threshold N]`**: surfaces drafts/proposed
  memories with `read_count >= N` — the natural promotion candidates.
- **Auto-tag on `memory add`**: tags inferred from anchor paths
  (e.g. anchoring `packages/mcp/...` adds tag `mcp`). Disable with
  `--no-auto-tag`.

### Changed
- **Improved literal `mem_search`**: queries now also match against
  anchor path basenames + segments, anchor symbols, module, and
  domain — not just id/tags/body. Multi-token queries still AND
  across all fields.
- **Improved `mem_for_files`**: surfaces memories where any tag
  matches an inferred module name, not only memories with the
  `module` field set.

### Tests
- 120 passing total (79 core + 17 embeddings + 16 mcp + 8 cli).

## [0.1.1] — security: drop heavy ML chain from default install

- **Breaking install behavior** : `@hivelore/embeddings` was an
  `optionalDependency` of `@hivelore/cli` and `@hivelore/mcp`, which means
  npm pulled it (and its full Transformers.js / onnxruntime / sharp
  dependency tree) on every install — bringing in 35 known
  vulnerabilities including a critical one (`protobufjs <7.5.5`,
  GHSA-xq3m-2v4x-88gg, via `onnx-proto`).
- It is now a `peerDependency` with `optional: true`. End users who
  do not need semantic search no longer pull the ML chain, going from
  ~150 transitive packages to ~20.
- Users who do want semantic search install it explicitly:
  `npm install @hivelore/embeddings`. The CLI/MCP code already lazy-imports
  it, so behavior is unchanged when present.
- Added a `protobufjs >=7.5.5` override at the workspace and embeddings
  package level to patch the critical vuln even when the ML chain is
  installed. `pnpm audit --prod` reports zero known vulnerabilities.

### Added — v0.4 (foundation cycle: real-world testing, staleness, validation, relevance, CRUD, review)

- **A. Real-world MCP integration.** Project-scoped `.mcp.json` so Claude
  Code auto-detects the local server. Multi-word literal `mem_search` (token
  AND across id/tags/body, case-insensitive) extracted to `@hivelore/core` and
  shared by CLI and MCP.
- **B. Staleness detection.** `verifyAnchor` checks that `anchor.paths`
  exist and `anchor.symbols` are still present in those files; `hivelore
  memory verify [--id X | --all] [--update]` and the `mem_verify` MCP tool
  optionally write back `status=stale` with `verified_at` and
  `stale_reason` to the frontmatter.
- **C. Passive validation + confidence levels.** Per-memory usage tracked
  in a sidecar (`.ai/.cache/usage.json`, gitignored). `mem_search` increments
  `read_count` and returns a derived `confidence` (`unverified | low | trusted
  | authoritative | stale`). New `mem_reject` tool / `hivelore memory reject`
  command records explicit rejections. `hivelore memory auto-promote
  [--min-reads N] [--max-rejections N] [--apply]` lifts proposed memories
  to validated based on real use.
- **D. Module-aware auto-loading.** `mem_for_files <files...>` infers
  modules from conventional layouts (`packages/`, `apps/`, `modules/`,
  `src/`) and returns relevant memories grouped by reason (anchor overlap,
  module match, domain match) plus inlined module-context files.
- **F. CRUD completeness.** `hivelore memory show / edit / rm` and the
  `mem_get` / `mem_delete` MCP tools.
- **E. Light memory PR workflow.** `hivelore memory pending` lists
  proposed memories awaiting review, sorted by reads desc; `hivelore memory
  approve <id>` and the `mem_approve` MCP tool perform an explicit review.

### Changed
- `mem_search` and `mem_list` now expose `confidence` and `read_count` on
  every hit; `mem_search` accepts a `track: false` opt-out.
- `@hivelore/embeddings` is now an `optionalDependency` of `@hivelore/mcp` so
  semantic mode works out of the box when the package is installed.

### Tests
- 105 passing (64 core / 17 embeddings / 16 mcp / 8 cli).

## [v0.3] — local embeddings + semantic search

- New `@hivelore/embeddings` package built on Transformers.js
  (`Xenova/bge-small-en-v1.5`, 384 dims), runs entirely locally.
- CLI: `hivelore embeddings index | query | status`. MCP: `mem_search` gains
  `semantic` + `min_score`, with graceful literal fallback when the index
  or package is missing.
- Cache at `.ai/.cache/embeddings/embeddings-index.json` with per-entry
  SHA-256 invalidation.

## [v0.2] — MCP server

- `@hivelore/mcp` (stdio) exposes 5 tools (`mem_save`, `mem_search`,
  `mem_list`, `get_project_context`, `bootstrap_project_save`) plus the
  `bootstrap_project` prompt. Bin `haive-mcp` and CLI command `hivelore mcp`.

## [v0.1] — foundations

- Monorepo (pnpm workspaces, Node 20 LTS, `tsup`, `vitest`).
- `@hivelore/core` memory schema (zod) + frontmatter parser/serializer + path
  resolution + recursive loader.
- `@hivelore/cli` first commands: `hivelore init`, `hivelore memory add | list |
  query | promote`. Approach B (Personal first): new memories default to
  `personal`; explicit `promote` is the only way into `team`.
