# hAIve Uses Pinned pnpm Workspaces

This repo is pinned to `pnpm@9.14.2` in root `packageManager`; do not use npm/yarn workspace commands for local development or release checks.

Cross-package hAIve dependencies must stay `workspace:*`. Using published semver ranges such as `^0.12.1` can make pnpm resolve stale registry packages instead of local workspace code, hiding source changes from dependent package builds.

Canonical local commands:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm -r build
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm -r test
```

Shells without global pnpm should use `npx pnpm@9.14.2 ...`; `haive doctor` reports this as `pnpm-not-on-path` so agents do not mistake the missing binary for a repo failure.
