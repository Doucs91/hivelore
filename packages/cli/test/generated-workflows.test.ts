/**
 * Every workflow `hivelore init` / `hivelore enforce install` writes into a user's repo MUST parse.
 *
 * This exists because it did not. Until v0.55.0 the `Upsert prevention receipt` step embedded a
 * multi-line `jq -nr` program inside a double-quoted YAML scalar; TypeScript turned the `\n`
 * escapes in the template literal into real newlines, which dedented the program to column 1 and
 * terminated the scalar. GitHub could not parse the file, so it ran ZERO jobs and reported only
 * "This run likely failed because of a workflow file issue" — a permanent, undiagnosable failure on
 * every PR and every push, in every repo that had run `hivelore init`. A field report from a real
 * user had to delete the file from two repositories by hand.
 *
 * The defect was three lines of test away the whole time. These are those lines.
