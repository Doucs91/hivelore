/**
 * Hivelore project configuration — .ai/haive.config.json
 *
 * In autopilot mode, Hivelore operates with zero human intervention:
 *   - Memories go directly to `validated` (no approval cycle)
 *   - `hivelore sync` auto-approves proposed memories after the delay
 *   - The MCP server saves a session recap automatically on exit
 *   - `get_briefing` auto-generates a minimal project context if none exists
 *   - `hivelore sync` applies safe self-maintenance repairs (context version, headings,
 *     needs_anchor tags, code-map refresh) without human intervention
 *
 * Multi-repo support:
 *   - crossRepoSources: pull shared memories from other repos on hivelore sync
 *   - contractFiles: watch API contract files for breaking changes
 *   - hubPath: local path to a shared team-knowledge hub repo
